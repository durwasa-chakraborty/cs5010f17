      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you
      practice programming with higher order functions (HOFs).
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use the HtDP
      <strong>Intermediate Student Language + Lambda</strong>
      for this problem set.
      You are to use HOFs wherever appropriate.
      These HOFs will replace most (and possibly all) of your
      uses of the <code>ListOfX</code> template.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        extras.rkt
      </a>
      and put it in the folder with your solutions.
      Then import this library by including the line
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require "extras.rkt")
    </pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file with the other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
    </pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check that your
      solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">
        coding conventions.
      </a>
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="../ProblemSets/yourID-log.txt">
        work session report
      </a>
      at the end of each work session.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add it to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set05</code> directory.
      Do this at the end of every work session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set05</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rewrite your <code>q1.rkt</code> from Problem Set 04
        to use higher-order functions whenever possible instead
        of using recursions to traverse lists.
        Provide the same functions as in Problem Set 04.
        Name your file <code>q1.rkt</code>, as in Problem Set 04.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rewrite your <code>q2.rkt</code> from Problem Set 04
        to use higher-order functions whenever possible instead
        of using recursions to traverse lists.
        Provide the same functions as in Problem Set 04.
        Name your file <code>q2.rkt</code>, as in Problem Set 04.
      </li>
