      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      with data design and with functions that operate on scalar and
      itemization data.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's HtDP Beginning Student Language
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        extras.rkt
      </a>
      and put it in the folder with your solutions.
      Then import this library by including the line
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require "extras.rkt")
    </pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file with the other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
    </pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function.  Thus, for problem 1, the top
      of your <code>q1.rkt</code> file should say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require 2htdp/universe)    ; needed for key=?
      (require "extras.rkt")
      
      (provide
        make-editor
        editor-pre
        editor-post
        editor?
        edit)
    </pre>
    <p>
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">
        coding conventions.
      </a>
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="../ProblemSets/yourID-log.txt">
        work session report
      </a>
      at the end of each work session.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add it to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set02</code> directory.
      Do this at the end of every work session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set02</code> directory, as well as your
      <code>q2.jpg</code> or <code>q2.png</code> file.

        Do exercise 84 (the function "edit") from
        Part I, section 5.10 of
        <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html">
          HtDP/2e.
        </a>
        <p>
          You are to write a file called <code>q1.rkt</code>
          that provides the following functions:
        </p>
        <pre>
          make-editor
          editor-pre
          editor-post
          editor?
          edit
        </pre>
        <p>
          For this problem, we will consider <code>KeyEvent</code>
          to be a scalar data type, which can be decomposed using
          the cases strategy.
          <code>KeyEvent</code> and <code>key=?</code> are defined
          in the <code>2htdp/universe</code> module.
          Look in Racket's Help Desk for details.
          To import <code>key=?</code>, you will need to <code>require</code>
          <code>2htdp/universe</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be doing automated testing of your solution, so
          be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set02/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010sp17/pdp-YOURUSERNAME</code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line somewhere near the top of your file:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "02" "q1.rkt")
        </pre>
      </li>

        (Finite State Machine)
        <br />
        This exercise is loosely based on Exercise 109 in HtDP/2e,
        but you will <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> create any displays.
        <p>
          As in Exercise 109, you are to design a finite-state machine
          and a set of functions that
          illustrate the workings of that machine.
          The machine you design will accept a sequence of letters
          (with each letter represented as a <code>1String</code>)
          if and only if that sequence matches the regular expression
        </p>
        <pre>
          (d* | d* p d* | s d* | s d* p d*) (d | d e)
        </pre>
        <p>
          The sequences <code>d</code>, <code>dd</code>, <code>sd</code>,
          <code>ddddpdd</code>, and <code>sddde</code> all match that
          regular expression, but the sequences
          <code>ddddp</code>, and <code>spe</code> do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your program must define two data types,
          <code>LegalInput</code> and <code>State</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>LegalInput</code> data type consists of the
          four one-letter strings that represent a legal second argument
          to your <code>next-state</code> function:
          <code>"d"</code>, <code>"p"</code>,
          <code>"s"</code>, and <code>"e"</code>.
          You do not need to give an interpretation for each
          <code>LegalInput</code>, because the problem makes
          sense even if the inputs are uninterpreted.
          (You might be interested to know, however, that this
          problem is related to the syntax of numerical constants
          in many programming languages.)
        </p>
        <p>
          To design your <code>State</code> data type, you will need
          to design your finite state machine as part of your information
          analysis and data design.  Your information analysis and design
          should produce a state-transition diagram
          (like the ones <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=state%20transition%20diagram&tbm=isch">here</a>)
          that shows the meaning of your machine states.
          Your data design should also include an interpretation
          for each state.
          Make your state-transition diagram as simple as you can,
          and submit a picture of it in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">
            JPEG
          </a>
          or
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">
            PNG
          </a>
          format as a separate file named
          <code>q2.jpg</code> or <code>q2.png</code>.
          You can create this file using a graphics program or by
          drawing your state transition diagram on a piece of paper
          and taking a good picture of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After you have done your data design, use your design to
          design and <code>provide</code> these four functions:
        </p>
        <pre>
          initial-state : Number -> State
          GIVEN: a number
          RETURNS: a representation of the initial state
              of your machine.  The given number is ignored.
          
          next-state : State LegalInput -> State
          GIVEN: a state of the machine and a machine input
          RETURNS: the state the machine should enter if it
              is in the given state and sees the given input.
          
          accepting-state? : State -> Boolean
          GIVEN: a state of the machine
          RETURNS: true iff the given state is a final (accepting) state
          
          rejecting-state? : State -> Boolean
          GIVEN: a state of the machine
          RETURNS: true iff there is no path (empty or non-empty) from
              the given state to an accepting state
        </pre>
        <p>
          Please note that some of your machine's states are
          likely to be neither accepting nor rejecting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
          solution, so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set02/q2.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010sp16/pdp-YOURUSERNAME</code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line somewhere near the top of your file:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "02" "q2.rkt")
        </pre>
      </li>
