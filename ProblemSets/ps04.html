    <p>
      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you some
      practice programming with lists.
      It will also give you a little more practice with data design
      and the Iterative Design Recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use the HtDP Intermediate Student Language for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        extras.rkt
      </a>
      and put it in the folder with your solutions.
      Then import this library by including the line
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require "extras.rkt")
    </pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file with the other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
    </pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check that your
      solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">
        coding conventions.
      </a>
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="../ProblemSets/yourID-log.txt">
        work session report
      </a>
      at the end of each work session.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add it to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set04</code> directory.
      Do this at the end of every work session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set04</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>

        You will build upon the simple animation of Problem Set 03
        by preserving all of its features and by adding these new
        features that allow doodads to be created and
        destroyed dynamically:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pressing the <code>"t"</code> key will create a
            gold star-like doodad with its center at position
            (125,120) and add that doodad to the world.
            The star-like doodad created by the
            first press of the <code>"t"</code> key will have
            velocity components vx = &minus;12 and vy = 10.
            The star-like doodad created by the
            second press of the <code>"t"</code> key will have
            velocity components vx = &minus;10 and vy = &minus;12.
            The star-like doodad created by the
            third press of the <code>"t"</code> key will have
            velocity components vx = 12 and vy = &minus;10.
            The star-like doodad created by the
            fourth press of the <code>"t"</code> key will have
            velocity components vx = 10 and vy = 12.
            And so on:  Each newly created star-like doodad
            has an initial velocity vector that's rotated 90 degrees
            clockwise from the initial velocity of the previously
            created star-like doodad.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressing the <code>"q"</code> key will create a
            gray square doodad with its center at position
            (460,350) and add that doodad to the world.
            The square doodad created by the
            first press of the <code>"q"</code> key will have
            velocity components vx = 9 and vy = &minus;13.
            The square doodad created by the
            second press of the <code>"q"</code> key will have
            velocity components vx = 13 and vy = 9.
            And so on:  Each newly created square doodad
            has an initial velocity vector that's rotated 90 degrees
            clockwise from the initial velocity of the previously
            created square doodad.
          </li>
          <li>
            Doodads that are created by key events behave the
            same as the two doodads that are present in the
            initial world.  In particular, they go through the
            same sequence of colors in response to Core Bounces,
            and can be selected and dragged jerklessly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The age of a doodad is the number of ticks that have
            elapsed since the doodad was added to the world.
            The age of a newly created doodad is zero, and the
            age of the two doodads that are present in the initial
            world is also zero until the first tick.
            Doodads grow older even if the world is paused.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressing the <code>"."</code> key will remove the
            oldest star-like doodad and the oldest square doodad
            from the world.  If there are several oldest star-like
            doodads, all of those oldest star-like doodads will be
            removed. If there are several oldest square doodads,
            all of those oldest square doodads will be removed.
            If there are no star-like doodads at all, then no
            star-like doodads will be removed.  If there are no
            square doodads at all, then no square doodads will be
            removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>"t"</code>, <code>"q"</code>, and
            <code>"."</code> key events behave as specified
            above even if the world is paused.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q1.rkt</code> that
          defines appropriate data types Doodad and World.
          That file must provide all of the following functions.
          Note that the list of the functions to be provided is
          the same as for question 2 of Problem Set 03 except the
          <code>world-doodad-star</code> and <code>world-doodad-square</code>
          functions have been replaced by the
          <code>world-doodads-star</code> and <code>world-doodads-square</code>
          functions, the <code>doodad-after-mouse-event</code> function
          has been dropped, and the <code>doodad-age</code> function
          has been added.

          Remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
          solution, so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set04/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010sp16/pdp-YOURUSERNAME</code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line somewhere near the top of your file:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "04" "q1.rkt")
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        For this second part of Problem Set 04, you will continue
        to use graphics coordinates but will not be drawing any
        pictures or animations.
        Since the coordinates do not correspond to pixels,
        they can be arbitrary real numbers.
        <p>
          You will design an idealized
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake#United_States_and_Canada">
            <code>Flapjack</code>
          </a>
          data type whose values represent perfectly circular pancakes,
          and an idealized
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frying_pan">
            <code>Skillet</code>
          </a>
          data type whose values represent perfectly circular frying pans.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q2.rkt</code> that
          defines the data types <code>Flapjack</code> and <code>Skillet</code>.
          That file must provide all of the following functions:
