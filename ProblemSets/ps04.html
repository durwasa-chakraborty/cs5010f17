    <p>
      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purposes of this problem set are to give you practice
      designing functions that deal with lists, and to get you started
      using the System Design Recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's Intermediate Student Language (ISL)
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">extras.rkt</a>
      and put it in the folder with your solutions.
      Then import this library by including the line
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require "extras.rkt")
</pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file with the other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
</pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous
      problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check
      that your solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">coding conventions</a>.
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add it to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set04</code> directory.
      Do this at the end of every work session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set04</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
</p>

<p>For question 1, you should require "extras.rkt" and rackunit but
nothing else.
</p>
<p>For question 2, you should require "extras.rkt", rackunit,
2htdp/image, and 2htdp/universe, but nothing else.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> For all universe programs,
      you may assume the mouse is never dragged or moved outside the canvas.
      Once the mouse enters the canvas, if the mouse ever leaves the canvas,
      then the behavior of your system is unspecified.
    </p>

        <p>
          For this first part of Problem Set 04, you will not
          need to do any data design because the <code>List</code>
          data type, and all specific instances of that data type
          such as <code>IntList</code> and <code>IntListList</code>,
          are predefined by the lessons for Module 04.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>inner product</em> of two sequences of real numbers
          <var>x<sub>1</sub></var>, ..., <var>x<sub>n</sub></var>
          and
          <var>y<sub>1</sub></var>, ..., <var>y<sub>n</sub></var>
          is defined as the sum of the pairwise products of
          corresponding numbers; in standard mathematical notation:
          &sum;<sub>i</sub>
          <var>x<sub>i</sub></var> <var>y<sub>i</sub></var>
        </p>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q1.rkt</code>
          that defines and provides all 4 of the following
          functions:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; inner-product : RealList RealList -&gt; Real
          ;;; GIVEN: two lists of real numbers
          ;;; WHERE: the two lists have the same length
          ;;; RETURNS: the inner product of those lists
          ;;; EXAMPLES:
          ;;;     (inner-product (list 2.5) (list 3.0))  =&gt;  7.5
          ;;;     (inner-product (list 1 2 3 4) (list 5 6 7 8))  =&gt;  70
          ;;;     (inner-product (list) (list))  =&gt;  0
          
          ;;; permutation-of? : IntList IntList -&gt; Boolean
          ;;; GIVEN: two lists of integers
          ;;; WHERE: neither list contains duplicate elements
          ;;; RETURNS: true if and only if one of the lists
          ;;;     is a permutation of the other
          ;;; EXAMPLES:

          ;;;     (permutation-of? (list 1 2 3) (list 1 2)) =&gt; false
          ;;;     (permutation-of? (list) (list)) =&gt; true
          
          ;;; shortlex-less-than? : IntList IntList -&gt; Boolean
          ;;; GIVEN: two lists of integers
          ;;; RETURNS: true if and only either
          ;;;     the first list is shorter than the second
          ;;;  or both are non-empty, have the same length, and either
          ;;;         the first element of the first list is less than
          ;;;             the first element of the second list
          ;;;      or the first elements are equal, and the rest of
          ;;;             the first list is less than the rest of the
          ;;;             second list according to shortlex-less-than?
          ;;; EXAMPLES:
          ;;;     (shortlex-less-than? (list) (list)) =&gt; false
          ;;;     (shortlex-less-than? (list) (list 3)) =&gt; true

</pre>
        <p>
          We will be doing automated testing of your solution,
          so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set04/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010f17/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line at the top of your file but after your
          <code>require</code> declarations:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "04" "q1.rkt")
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        (SquashPractice3)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this second problem, your job is to improve the
          simulation specified by Problem Set 03 by changing
          the definition of ball-racket collisions and by adding
          a new feature that allows expert squash players to
          challenge themselves by trying to keep multiple balls
          in play at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make it easier to keep multiple balls in play, the
          definition of a collision between ball and racket is
          changed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The ball collides with the racket if and only if
            all of the following are true:
            <ol>
              <li>
                The ball's position in the previous tick
                does not lie on the 47-pixel line segment of
                the racket in the previous tick.
              </li>
              <li>
                The vy component of the ball's tentative
                velocity is either zero or negative.
              </li>
              <li>
                The line that connects the ball's position
                in the previous tick with the first tentative
                position calculated for the ball in this tick
                intersects the 47-pixel line segment that
                represents the racket's new position for this
                tick.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The other changes are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When the simulation is in a rally state,
            pressing the <code>b</code> key creates a new ball
            with position components (330,384) and velocity
            components (3,-9).
            This new ball behaves like the original
            ball, as specified by Problem Set 03.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the simulation is not in a rally state,
            pressing the <code>b</code> key does nothing.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a ball collides with the back wall, it disappears
            from the simulation.
            If its disappearance leaves no more balls within the
            simulation, the rally state ends as though the space
            bar had been pressed.
            The rally state does not end until all balls have
            disappeared or the space bar is pressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Balls never collide with each other, even if they
            have the same position coordinates.
            (In the three-dimensional real-world, two balls with
            the same x and y components are likely to be at
            different altitudes, which your simulation does not
            model.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q2.rkt</code>
          that defines appropriate data types Ball, Racket, and
          World, defines and provides the fifteen functions
          specified in part 1 of Problem Set 03 except for
          <code>world-ball</code>,
          defines and provides all three functions specified in
          part 2 of Problem Set 03,
          and also defines and provides the <code>world-balls</code>
          function specified below:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; world-balls : World -&gt; BallList
          ;;; GIVEN: a world
          ;;; RETURNS: a list of the balls that are present in the world
          ;;;     (but does not include any balls that have disappeared
          ;;;     by colliding with the back wall)
</pre>
        <p>
          We recommend you practice the Iterative Design Recipe
          by making a copy of your (corrected) <code>q2.rkt</code> file
          from Problem Set 03 and placing that copy and a copy of
          <code>extras.rkt</code> in a new <code>set04</code>
          directory.  Then, before you forget it, delete the
          <code>provide</code> for <code>world-ball</code> and
          add a <code>provide</code> for <code>world-balls</code>.
          Then change <code>set04/q2.rkt</code> as necessary so
          it implements the simulator as specified for this
          problem set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that we will be doing automated testing of your solution,
          so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set04/q2.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010f17/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></code> repository),
          and that it provides all of the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line at the top of your file but after your
          <code>require</code> declarations:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "04" "q2.rkt")
</pre>
      </li>
