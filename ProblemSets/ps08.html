      This is a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">
        pair programming
      </a>
      assignment.  You are required to
      complete this problem set in collaboration with your assigned
      partner, but neither of you are allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in previous problem sets,
      you and your partner are required to push your files at
      the end of every work session.
      (You <em>may</em> push your files several times during
      a work session, but we do not require you to do so.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of every work session, you are required to update
      your log file to record the time you spent in that work session.
      (Please do not include the time you spent in any previous work
      sessions, as those times will already have been recorded in
      previous versions of your log file.)
      If both of you work together during a work session, both of
      you must update your log files, recording only the time <em>you</em>
      spent working.  Do not include your partner's time in
      your log file, but be sure to push the updated versions of
      both log files.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This problem set is designed to give you a chance to make
      your scheduling program run faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use the HtDP
      <strong>Intermediate Student Language + Lambda</strong>
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in previous problem sets, you must download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        <code>extras.rkt</code>
      </a>
      and push it to the <code>set08</code> directory with your solutions.
      Then import that library by including the line
      <code>(require "extras.rkt")</code>
      at the top of your files with your other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Following those <code>require</code> declarations,
      write <code>provide</code> declarations that provide all of
      the functions you are required to provide, without providing any
      functions you are not required to provide.
      That will allow our testing framework to import your files
      and do automated testing on them.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check that your
      files are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">
        coding conventions.
      </a>
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.

  <h3>
    Problem Specification
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Copy your <code>q2.rkt</code> program of Problem Set 07
      to a file named <code>set08/q1.rkt</code>.
      Modify <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>flight.rkt</code>
      as necessary to make your program run in
      <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolynomialTime.html">
        polynomial time.
      </a>
      <p>
        As in Problem Set 07, your program must respect
        the abstraction barrier associated with the
        <code>UTC</code> and <code>Flight</code>
        abstract data types.
        As in Problem Set 06, you are allowed to implement those
        ADTs as you see fit.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      After you have finished your <code>set07/q1.rkt</code> program,
      analyze its asymptotic running time.
      In a plain text file named <code>set08/q2.txt</code>,
      write a one-sentence summary of its asymptotic running time.
      <p>
        Following that sentence, display a table showing how the
        running time of your optimized program varies with the
        parameter <code>n</code> for the simple benchmark shown below,
        using a range of values for <code>n</code> that is adequate
        to illustrate the asymptotic running time you are claiming
        for your program.
      </p>
