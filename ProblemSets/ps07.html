      This is a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">
        pair programming
      </a>
      assignment.  You are required to
      complete this problem set in collaboration with your assigned
      partner, but neither of you are allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in previous problem sets,
      you and your partner are required to push your files at
      the end of every work session.
      (You <em>may</em> push your files several times during
      a work session, but we do not require you to do so.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of every work session, you are required to update
      your log file to record the time you spent in that work session.
      (Please do not include the time you spent in any previous work
      sessions, as those times will already have been recorded in
      previous versions of your log file.)
      If both of you work together during a work session, both of
      you must update your log files, recording only the time <em>you</em>
      spent working.  Do not include your partner's time in
      your log file, but be sure to push the updated versions of
      both log files.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This problem set has two purposes.
      One is to give you some appreciation for abstract data types.
      Another is to give you some practice with invariants and contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use the HtDP
      <strong>Intermediate Student Language + Lambda</strong>
      for this problem set.
      You should use HOFs wherever appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in previous problem sets, you must download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        <code>extras.rkt</code>
      </a>
      and push it to the <code>set07</code> directory with your solutions.
      Then import that library by including the line
      <code>(require "extras.rkt")</code>
      at the top of your files with your other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Following those <code>require</code> declarations,
      write <code>provide</code> declarations that provide all of
      the functions you are required to provide, without providing any
      functions you are not required to provide.
      That will allow our testing framework to import your files
      and do automated testing on them.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check that your
      files are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first question in this problem set,
      you must also download a copy of
      <a href="flight.rkt">
        <code>flight.rkt</code>
      </a>
      and use that implementation of <code>flight.rkt</code>
      instead of the <code>flight.rkt</code> file you wrote
      for Problem Set 06.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">
        coding conventions.
      </a>
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>

  <h3>
    Problem Specification
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Copy your <code>q2.rkt</code> program of Problem Set 06
      to a file named <code>set07/q1.rkt</code>.
      Create a plain text file named <code>set07/q1.txt</code> as well.
      Modify your <code>q1.rkt</code> program as necessary to respect
      the abstraction barrier associated with the
      <code>UTC</code> and <code>Flight</code>
      abstract data types, without changing any of the <code>provide</code>
      declarations, contracts, or purpose statements from Problem Set 06.
      <p>
        Record all of the changes that were necessary in
        your <code>q1.txt</code> file; when you're done, that file
        will tell you some of the things you did wrong on Problem Set 06.
        Test your program using the
        <a href="flight.rkt">
          <code>flight.rkt</code>
        </a>
        file given to you for this assignment.
        When your <code>q1.rkt</code> program respects the
        abstraction barrier of the <code>UTC</code> and <code>Flight</code>
        ADTs, that program should run with either one of the two
        <code>flight.rkt</code> files: the one you wrote for Problem Set 06
        and the one given to you by the course staff for this assignment.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      After you have modified your <code>set07/q1.rkt</code> program
      as necessary to respect abstraction barriers, make a copy of it
      in <code>set07/q2.rkt</code>.
      Modify that program as necessary to work without the preconditions
      that say there are no non-trivial round trips.
      <p>
        In other words:  Define and <code>provide</code> the three functions
        specified below.
      </p>

        ;;;     time is necessary, so it is possible to arrive at 1500
        ;;;     and leave immediately on a different flight that departs
        ;;;     at 1500

        ;;; GIVEN: the names of two airports, ap1 and ap2 (respectively),

        ;;;     the second airport (ap2) using only the given flights
        ;;; RETURNS: the number of minutes it takes to fly from the first
        ;;;     airport (ap1) to the second airport (ap2), including any
        ;;;     layovers, by the fastest possible route that uses only
        ;;;     the given flights
