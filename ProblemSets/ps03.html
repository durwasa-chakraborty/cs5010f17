      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to introduce you to
      <href a="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming"
      >functional reactive programming</a>
      in DrRacket's Universe model, and to get you started with the
      Iterative Design Recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also gain experience with the Elastic Collision
      and Smooth Dragging idioms we'll be using in several
      subsequent problem sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's HtDP Intermediate Student Language (ISL)
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">extras.rkt</a>
      and put it in the folder with your solutions.
      Then import this library by including the line
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require "extras.rkt")
    </pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file with the other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)</pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous
      problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check
      that your solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">deliverables</a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">coding conventions</a>.
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">work session report</a>
      at the end of each work session.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add it to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set03</code> directory.
      Do this at the end of every work session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set03</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>

      <strong>Note:</strong> For all universe programs,
      you may assume the mouse is never dragged or moved outside the canvas.
      Once the mouse enters the canvas, if the mouse ever leaves the canvas,
      then the behavior of your system is unspecified.

        (SquashPractice1)
        <br />
        <p>
          Your job is to build a simple simulation of a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(sport)">squash</a>
          player practicing without an opponent.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The simulation is a universe program that displays
            the positions and motions of a squash ball and the
            player's racket moving within a rectangular court.
          </li>
          <li>
            The court is 425 pixels wide and 649 pixels high.
            We use graphics coordinates in which the top leftmost pixel
            has coordinates (0,0).
            The court walls are displayed as a black outline,
            but the court's floor is displayed as a white background
            on which the ball and racket may be drawn.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ball is displayed as a black circle of radius 3 pixels.
            The racket is displayed as a green rectangle whose
            horizontal sides are 47 pixels long and whose
            vertical sides are 7 pixels long.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ball and racket are therefore displayed larger than
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(ratio)">scale</a>.
            The simulation approximates the real-world dimensions
            and compressibility of the ball and racket by treating
            the ball as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_particle">point
            particle</a>
            and the racket as a horizontal line segment with zero thickness.
            The ball's position corresponds to the center of its
            displayed circle, and the racket's position corresponds
            to the center of its displayed rectangle.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ball and racket each have their own velocity,
            with each velocity comprising two components vx and vy
            telling how many pixels the ball or racket moves on each tick
            in the x and y directions, respectively.
            (We are using graphics coordinates, so a positive value for vy
            means the ball or racket is moving downward.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The simulation starts in a ready-to-serve state, with
            the ball and racket both at graphics coordinates (330,384),
            both with zero velocity.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the simulation is in ready-to-serve state, pressing
            the space bar changes the simulation's overall state to a
            rally state, and changes the ball's velocity components to
            (3,-9).
          </li>
          <li>
            When the simulation is in a rally state, pressing the space
            bar pauses the simulation for three seconds of real time
            (which can be measured in ticks by using the speed of the
            simulation to calculate the number of ticks per second).
            During those three seconds, the ball and racket do not move,
            and the background color of the court changes from white to
            yellow.
            At the end of the three seconds, the simulation resets to
            its ready-to-serve state, and the background color to white,
            as though the simulation was
            just starting.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the simulation is in a rally state, the velocity of
            the racket can be changed by pressing the arrow keys:
            <ul>
              <li>
                pressing the left arrow key decreases the vx component by 1
              </li>
              <li>
                pressing the right arrow key increases the vx component by 1
              </li>
              <li>
                pressing the up arrow key decreases the vy component by 1
              </li>
              <li>
                pressing the left arrow key increases the vy component by 1
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The racket's vy velocity component can also change when the
            ball collides with the racket (see below).
            When the ball collides with the racket, and the racket's vy
            velocity component is negative, that vy component increases
            to zero.  Otherwise the vy component remains unchanged.
          </li>
          <li>
            The velocity of the ball changes only when the ball collides
            with a wall of the court or with the racket.
            When the ball collides with the front (top) wall of the court,
            the vy component of its velocity is negated.
            When the ball collides with a side wall of the court,
            the vx component of its velocity is negated.
            When the ball collides with the racket (see below),
            the vx component of the ball's velocity stays the same
            but its vy component becomes the vx component of the racket's
            velocity minus the old vy component of the ball's velocity.
            These adjustments to the ball's velocity are made only following
            a tick.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ball collides with the racket if and only if
            the path of the ball during the tick intersects the
            47-pixel line segment that represents the racket's
            position at the end of the tick.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ball collides with a wall if and only if
            the ball does not collide with the racket and
            the ball's tentative new position, obtained by adding
            the components of its previous velocity to the
            corresponding components of its previous position,
            <unquote>
              lies outside the court.
            </unquote>
            If the tentative y component is less than zero,
            then the ball has collided with the front wall,
            and its new y component will be the negation of its
            tentative y component.
            If the tentative x component is less than zero,
            then the ball has collided with the left wall,
            and its new x component will be the negation of its
            tentative x component.
            If the tentative x component is greater than 425,
            then the ball has collided with the right wall,
            and its new x component will be 425 minus the
            difference between tentative x component and 425.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that it is possible for the ball to collide
            with more than one wall, so the x and y components
            computed above must themselves be regarded as tentative
            and subject to the same adjustments as described for
            the original tentative values of those components.
          </li>
          <li>
            The racket can also collide with a wall, and is deemed
            to have collided with a wall whenever its tentative new position,
            calculated by adding its velocity components to the corresponding
            components of its previous positions, results in any part
            of the 47-pixel line segment that represents the racket
            extending outside the court.
            If the racket collides with a side wall, its x component
            is adjusted to keep the racket touching the wall and
            inside the court.
            If the racket collides with the front wall,
            the rally state ends as though the space bar had been
            pressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the ball collides with the back wall, the rally state
            ends as though the space bar had been pressed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q1.rkt</code>
          that defines appropriate data types Ball, Racket, and
          World and defines and provides all 15 of the following
          functions:

          We will be doing automated testing of your solution,
          so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set03/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010f17/pdp-<em>YOURUSERNAME</em></code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line at the top of your file but after your
          <code>require</code> declarations:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "03" "q1.rkt")
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        (SquashPractice2)
        <br />
        <p>
          For this second problem, your job is to add Smooth Dragging,
          specified as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When the simulation is in a rally state,
            the racket becomes selectable and draggable.
            Depressing the mouse button when the mouse is
            positioned no more than 25 pixels away from the
            center of the racket selects and grabs the racket.
            The location of the mouse is indicated by a solid
            blue circle of radius 4 pixels; note that this circle
            might well lie completely outside the rectangle
            displaying the racket's position.
            Simply pressing the mouse button, without moving
            the mouse, should select the racket but should not move it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the racket has been selected, you should be able
            to drag it around the court using your mouse.
            As you drag the racket, the position of the mouse
            (as indicated by the solid blue circle) should not
            change relative to the racket's position.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the mouse button is released, the racket
            becomes unselected, and the blue circle disappears.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the simulation is in a ready-to-serve state,
            the racket is not selected and cannot be selected
            or dragged.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q2.rkt</code>
          that defines appropriate data types Ball, Racket, and
          World, defines and provides all fifteen functions
          specified for the first question of this problem set,
          and also defines and provides the following three functions:

        <pre>
          ;;; world-after-mouse-event
          ;;;     : World Int Int MouseEvent -&gt; World
          ;;; GIVEN: a world, the x and y coordinates of a mouse event,
          ;;;     and the mouse event
          ;;; RETURNS: the world that should follow the given world after
          ;;;     the given mouse event

          ;;; GIVEN: a racket, the x and y coordinates of a mouse event,
          ;;;     and the mouse event
