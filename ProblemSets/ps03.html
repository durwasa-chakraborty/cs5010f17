      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to introduce you to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">
        functional reactive programming
      </a>
      in DrRacket's Universe model,
      and to get you started with the Iterative Design Recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also gain experience with the Core Bounce and Jerkless Dragging
      idioms we'll be using in several subsequent exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use the HtDP Intermediate Student Language for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these problems, download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        extras.rkt
      </a>
      and put it in the folder with your solutions.
      Then import this library by including the line
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require "extras.rkt")
    </pre>
    <p>
      at the top of your file with the other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Then, for each problem, put in lines that say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide <var>function</var>)
    </pre>
    <p>
      for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
      This will allow our testing framework to import your file
      and do automated testing on it.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check that your
      solutions are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">
        coding conventions.
      </a>
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to fill out a
      <a href="../ProblemSets/yourID-log.txt">
        work session report
      </a>
      at the end of each work session.
      Tell <code>git</code> to add it to the files you will commit,
      and then commit and push (sync) that report in addition to
      committing and pushing your entire <code>set03</code> directory.
      Do this at the end of every work session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to include a copy of <code>extras.rkt</code> racket
      in your <code>set03</code> directory along with your
      <code>q1.rkt</code> and <code>q2.rkt</code> files.
    </p>

      <li>
        Your job is to build a simple animation, specified as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The animation is a universe program that displays
            two doodads moving around in a rectangular enclosure.
          </li>
          <li>
            The enclosure is 601 pixels wide and 449 pixels high.
            We are using graphics coordinates in which the top leftmost
            pixel has coordinates (0,0).
          </li>
          <li>
            One doodad is displayed as a <code>radial-star</code>
            with 8 points, an inner radius of 10 pixels,
            and an outer radius of 50 pixels.
            The other doodad is displayed as a <code>square</code>
            whose sides are 71 pixels long.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both doodads change color whenever they execute a Core Bounce
            (described below).
            The star-like doodad starts out Gold, but changes to Green
            on its first Core Bounce, then to Blue on its second Core
            Bounce, and then turns back to Gold on its third Core Bounce,
            cycling through those three colors endlessly.
            The square doodad cycles through five colors:
            Gray, OliveDrab, Khaki, Orange, Crimson.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both doodads have a velocity with two components, vx and vy,
            which tell how many pixels the doodad moves on each tick in
            the x and y directions, respectively.  (We are using graphics
            coordinates, so a positive value for vy means the doodad is
            moving downward.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The star-like doodad starts out with its center at position
            (125,120) and velocity components vx=10 and vy=12.
            The square doodad starts out with its center at position
            (460,350) and (negative) velocity components vx=&minus;13
            and vy=&minus;9.
          </li>
          <li>
            The animation is active (not paused) at first, but can be
            frozen (paused) by pressing the space bar.
            Pressing the space bar a second time un-freezes the animation.
            The animation can be frozen and un-frozen as many times as
            desired, with the space bar acting as a toggle between the
            frozen and unfrozen states.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the animation is frozen (using the space bar), then both
            doodads remain at their current positions.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the animation is not frozen, then their new positions
            and velocities following a tick are calculated by adding
            the vx velocity component to the x position to obtain a
            tentative new x position, and by adding the vy velocity
            component to the y position to obtain a tentative new y
            position.  If the tentative x position is greater than
            or equal to 0 and strictly less than 601, then it becomes
            the new x position and the vx component of the doodad's
            velocity does not change.  If the tentative y position is
            greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than 449,
            then it becomes the new y position and the vy component
            of the doodad's velocity does not change.
          </li>
          <li>
            If either of the tentative x and y positions lies outside
            the range specified above, the doodad performs a core bounce.
            If a tentative x or y position is negative, its absolute
            value becomes the new x or y position and the doodad's
            corresponding velocity component (vx or vy) is negated.
            If a tentative x position tx is greater than or equal to 601
            then the doodad's new x position becomes 600 - (tx - 600)
            and its vx velocity component is negated.
            If a tentative y position ty is greater than or equal to 449
            then the doodad's new y position becomes 448 - (ty - 448)
            and its vy velocity component is negated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that a core bounce can negate one or both of the
            velocity components.  Even if both velocity components
            are negated following a tick, it counts as just one
            core bounce, so there is only one change of color.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q1.rkt</code> that
          defines appropriate data types Doodad and World and
          provides all twelve of the following functions:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;;; animation : PosReal -> World
          ;;; GIVEN: the speed of the animation, in seconds per tick
          ;;;     (so larger numbers run slower)

          ;;; RETURNS: the World that should follow the given World

          ;;; world-paused? : World -> Boolean
          ;;; GIVEN: a World
          ;;; RETURNS: true iff the World is paused

          ;;; GIVEN: a World
          ;;; RETURNS: the star-like Doodad of the World
          
          ;;; world-doodad-square : World -> Doodad
          ;;; GIVEN: a World
          ;;; RETURNS: the square Doodad of the World
          
          ;;; doodad-x : Doodad -> Integer
          ;;; doodad-y : Doodad -> Integer
          ;;; GIVEN: a Doodad

          We will be doing automated testing of your solution, so
          be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set03/q1.rkt</code> in your private
          <code>cs5010sp17/pdp-YOURUSERNAME</code> repository),
          and that it provides all the functions listed above.
          To see if your file is in the right place, insert the
          following line somewhere near the top of your file:
        </p>
        <pre>
          (check-location "03" "q1.rkt")
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        For this second problem, your job is to add jerkless dragging
        and a couple of other new features:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Both doodads are selectable and draggable.
            Depressing the mouse button when the mouse is positioned
            within a doodad's outline selects and grabs the doodad.
            The location within the doodad where it has been grabbed
            is indicated by a solid black circle of radius 3 pixels.
            Simply pressing the mouse button, without moving the mouse,
            should not move the doodad.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a doodad has been selected, you should be able to drag
            it around the enclosure using your mouse.
            As you drag it, the position of the mouse within the doodad
            (as indicated by the solid black circle) should not change
            relative to the doodad's center.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that selecting and dragging should work even if the
            animation is paused.  Note also that, when the doodads
            overlap, it is possible to
            select both doodads at once and to drag both around the
            enclosure at the same time.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the mouse button is released, all selected doodads
            become unselected, and the black circle showing where
            a selected doodad has been grabbed disappears.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressing the "c" key has no effect unless one or both
            doodads are selected.  If any doodads are selected,
            however, pressing the "c" key causes all selected
            doodads to change to their next color just as though
            they had executed a core bounce, even though the velocity
            components of the doodads remain unchanged.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are to deliver a file named <code>q2.rkt</code> that
          defines appropriate data types Doodad and World,
          defines and provides all twelve of the functions specified
          for the first question of this problem set, and also
          defines and provides the following three functions:
        </p>
        <pre>
          ;; world-after-mouse-event
          ;;     : World Int Int MouseEvent -> World
          ;; GIVEN: A world, the x- and y-coordinates of a mouse event, and the
          ;;     mouse event
          ;; RETURNS: the world that should follow the given world after the
          ;;     given mouse event
          
          ;; doodad-after-mouse-event :  Doodad Int Int MouseEvent -> Doodad
          ;; GIVEN: A doodad, the x- and y-coordinates of a mouse event, and
          ;;     the mouse event
          ;; RETURNS: the doodad as it should be after the given mouse event
          
          ;; doodad-selected? : Doodad -> Boolean
          ;; RETURNS: true iff the given doodad is selected
        </pre>
        <p>
          Remember that we will be doing automated testing of your
          solution, so be sure your solution is in the right place
          (<code>set03/q2.rkt</code> in your private
