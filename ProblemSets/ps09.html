      This is a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">
        pair programming
      </a>
      assignment.  You are required to
      complete this problem set in collaboration with your assigned
      partner, but neither of you are allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have created a repository for you and your partner to use
      in this problem set and for the next two problem sets as well.
      The name of that repository is of the form
      <code>pdp-<em>ID1</em>-<em>ID2</em></code>,
      where <code><em>ID1</em></code> is either your CCIS ID
      or your partner's CCIS ID, and <code><em>ID2</em></code>
      is the other CCIS ID for your team.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those repositories, we have created files named
      <code><em>ID1</em>-log.txt</code> and
      <code><em>ID2</em>-log.txt</code> for you to use when
      filing work session reports, as in previous problem sets.
      You and your partner are required to push your files at
      the end of every work session.
      (You <em>may</em> push your files several times during
      a work session, but we do not require you to do so.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of every work session, you are required to update
      your log file to record the time you spent in that work session.
      (Please do not include the time you spent in any previous work
      sessions, as those times will already have been recorded in
      previous versions of your log file.)
      If both of you work together during a work session, both of
      you must update your log files, recording only the time <em>you</em>
      spent working.  Do not include your partner's time in
      your log file, but be sure to push the updated versions of
      both log files.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      applying what you have learned in previous assignments to
      object-oriented programming in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Java 8 for this assignment.
      All of your code must reside within the default package.
      You may use/import anything in the
      <code>java.lang</code> and <code>java.util</code>
      packages, but you are not allowed to use any other packages.

  <h3>
    Problem Specification
  </h3>
  <p>
    You will translate your polynomial-time solution to the flight
    scheduling problem from Racket to Java.
    Your translation will use the data types specified in this
    problem set, which will allow us to write black-box tests
    we can use to test all of the solutions submitted by students
    taking the course.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have divided that problem into two parts.
    In the first part, you will implement three abstract data types.
    In the second part, you will use those ADTs in your solution to
    the scheduling problem.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We are giving you three Java files, which define three
      abstract data types:
      <a href="UTC.java"><code>UTC</code></a>,
      <a href="Flight.java"><code>Flight</code></a>, and
      <a href="RacketList.java"><code>RacketList&lt;E&gt;</code></a>.
      You must copy those three files into your team's
      <code>set09</code> directory without changing them in any way.
      <p>
        In a file named <code>UTCs.java</code>, define a public class
        named <code>UTCs</code> that defines the following
        public static factory method:
      </p>
      <pre>
        // GIVEN: the hour in [0,23] and the minute in [0,59]
        // RETURNS: a UTC with that hour and minute
        
        public static UTC make (int h, int m) {
            ...
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        In a file named <code>Flights.java</code>, define a public class
        named <code>Flights</code> that defines the following
        public static factory method:
      </p>
      <pre>
        // GIVEN: the name of a flight, the name of the airport from
        //     which the flight departs, the name of the airport at
        //     which the flight arrives, the time of departure in UTC,
        //     and the time of arrival in UTC
        // RETURNS: a flight value that encapsulates the given information
        
        public static Flight make (String s, String ap1, String ap2,
                                   UTC t1, UTC t2) {
            ...
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        In a file named <code>RacketLists.java</code>, define a public class
        named <code>RacketLists</code> that defines the following
        public static factory method:
      </p>
      <pre>
        // GIVEN: no arguments
        // RETURNS: an empty RacketList&lt;E&gt;
        
        public static &lt;E&gt; RacketList&lt;E&gt; empty () {
            ...
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        You may add more static methods to those three classes
        if you wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complete your implementation of the three ADTs specified above
        by defining more classes.  You will probably want to put at
        least some of those classes in separate files, but all files
        must be added to your <code>set09</code> directory and pushed
        to your team's repository.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      In the second part of this problem set, you will translate your
      polynomial-time solution to the scheduling problem from Racket
      to Java.
      <p>
        We are giving you a
        <a href="FlightExamples.java"><code>FlightExamples.java</code></a>
        file that defines the lists of flights used in the examples below.
        You will need to define more lists of flights for use in your own
        testing.  In particular, you will need to write benchmarks that
        test the performance of the three methods specified below.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a file named <code>Schedules.java</code>, define a public class
        named <code>Schedules</code> that defines the following
        public static methods:
      </p>
      <pre>
        // GIVEN: the names of two airports, ap1 and ap2 (respectively),
        //     and a RacketList&lt;Flight&gt; that describes all of the flights a
        //     traveller is willing to consider taking
        // RETURNS: true if and only if it is possible to fly from the
        //     first airport (ap1) to the second airport (ap2) using
        //     only the given flights
        // EXAMPLES:
        //     canGetThere ("06N", "JFK", FlightExamples.panAmFlights)  =>  false
        //     canGetThere ("JFK", "JFK", FlightExamples.panAmFlights)  =>  true
        //     canGetThere ("06N", "LAX", FlightExamples.deltaFlights)  =>  false
        //     canGetThere ("LAX", "06N", FlightExamples.deltaFlights)  =>  false
        //     canGetThere ("LGA", "PDX", FlightExamples.deltaFlights)  =>  true
        
        public static boolean canGetThere (String ap1,
                                           String ap2,
                                           RacketList&lt;Flight&gt; flights) {
            ...
        }
                
        // GIVEN: the names of two airports, ap1 and ap2 (respectively),
        //     and a RacketList&lt;Flight&gt; that describes all of the flights a
        //     traveller is willing to consider taking
        // WHERE: it is possible to fly from the first airport (ap1) to
        //     the second airport (ap2) using only the given flights
        // RETURNS: a list of flights that tells how to fly from the
        //     first airport (ap1) to the second airport (ap2) in the
        //     least possible time, using only the given flights
        // NOTE: to simplify the problem, your program should incorporate
        //     the totally unrealistic simplification that no layover
        //     time is necessary, so it is possible to arrive at 1500
        //     and leave immediately on a different flight that departs
        //     at 1500
        // EXAMPLES:
        //     fastestItinerary ("JFK", "JFK", FlightExamples.panAmFlights)
        //         =>  RacketLists.empty()
        //
        //     fastestItinerary ("LGA", "PDX", FlightExamples.deltaFlights)
        // =>  RacketLists.empty().cons
        //         (Flights.make ("Delta 2163",
        //                        "MSP", "PDX",
        //                        UTCs.make (15, 0), UTCs.make (19, 2))).cons
        //             (Flights.make ("Delta 0121",

        //                            UTCs.make (14, 9)))
        //
        // (Note: The Java syntax for a method call makes those calls
        // to cons look backwards from what you're used to in Racket.)
