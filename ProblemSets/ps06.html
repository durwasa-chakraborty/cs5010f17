      <strong>Out:</strong> Monday, 20 February 2017
      <br />
      <strong>Due:</strong> Monday, 27 February 2017 at 6pm
      <br />
      <strong>Corrected:</strong> Tuesday, 21 February,
      to correct the return type for
      <code>departs-at</code> and  <code>arrives-at</code>
      <strong>Corrected:</strong> Thursday, 23 February,
      to correct the example for
      <code>flight=?</code>

    <p>
      This is a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">
        pair programming
      </a>
      assignment.  You are required to
      complete this problem set in collaboration with your assigned
      partner, but neither of you are allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have created a repository for you and your partner to use
      in this problem set and for the next two problem sets as well.
      The name of that repository is of the form
      <code>pdp-<em>ID1</em>-<em>ID2</em></code>,
      where <code><em>ID1</em></code> is either your CCIS ID
      or your partner's CCIS ID, and <code><em>ID2</em></code>
      is the other CCIS ID for your team.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those repositories, we have created files named
      <code><em>ID1</em>-log.txt</code> and
      <code><em>ID2</em>-log.txt</code> for you to use when
      filing work session reports, as in previous problem sets.
      You and your partner are required to push your files at
      the end of every work session.
      (You <em>may</em> push your files several times during
      a work session, but we do not require you to do so.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of every work session, you are required to update
      your log file to record the time you spent in that work session.
      (Please do not include the time you spent in any previous work
      sessions, as those times will already have been recorded in
      previous versions of your log file.)
      If both of you work together during a work session, both of
      you must update your log files, recording only the time <em>you</em>
      spent working.  Do not include your partner's time in
      your log file, but be sure to push the updated versions of
      both log files.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you practice
      working in tandem with another programmer.
      This problem set will also give you more
      practice programming with lists and higher order functions,
      and will lay the foundation for a subsequent problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use the HtDP
      <strong>Intermediate Student Language + Lambda</strong>
      for this problem set.
      You should use HOFs wherever appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in previous problem sets, you must download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        extras.rkt
      </a>
      and push it to the <code>set06</code> directory with your solutions.
      Then import that library by including the line
      <code>(require "extras.rkt")</code>
      at the top of your files with your other <code>require</code>
      declarations.  Following those <code>require</code> declarations,
      write <code>provide</code> declarations that provide all of
      the functions you are required to provide, without providing any
      functions you are not required to provide.
      That will allow our testing framework to import your files
      and do automated testing on them.
      You can use <code>check-location</code> to double-check that your
      files are in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you must follow the design recipe, which is a
      process, not a list of deliverables.
      Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the artifacts produced by the various steps of the
      design recipe: data definitions (including interpretation and
      templates, contracts, purpose statements, definitions, and tests).
      Be sure to follow our
      <a href="../Info/style.html">
        coding conventions.
      </a>
      Doing so will make codewalks easier for everyone.

  <h3>
    Problem Specification
  </h3>
  <p>
    The program you are to write solves a simple flight scheduling
    problem:  What is the quickest way to get from one airport to
    another using a given set of scheduled flights?
  </p>
  <p>
    This is, of course, a variation on Problem Set 00.
    You and your partner are allowed to use any code either of you
    wrote for Problem Set 00.  You are also allowed to use any
    code, including tests, given to you by course staff.
    You are not allowed to use code or tests written by anyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have divided that problem into two parts.
    In the first part, you will implement two abstract data types.
    In the second part, you will use those ADTs in your solution to
    the scheduling problem.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a file named <code>flight.rkt</code>, write data definitions
      for the UTC and Flight data types specified below, define all
      11 of the functions associated with those types as specified
      below, and
      <code>provide</code> all of those functions.
