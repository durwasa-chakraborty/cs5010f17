      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this problem set is to give you some practice
      with the systems we will use in CS 5010.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, you need to know how to commit your solution
      and how to push your commits to the course's GitHub site.
      To submit your solution, follow our instructions on
      <a href="../Info/submission.html">
        How to Submit Your Homework,
      </a>
      and be sure to include the required
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables.
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will check to see whether your have submitted a solution
      for this problem set and whether it contains the required
      deliverables, but this problem set will not otherwise be
      graded.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Racket's HtDP Beginning Student Language
      for this problem set.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should begin your work on this problem set by using
      <code>git</code> to clone your GitHub repository from the
      <a href="https://github.ccs.neu.edu/cs5010sp17">
        CS 5010 GitHub site.
      </a>
      The name of your GitHub repository is
      <code>pdp-</code><var>YOURNAME</var>, where <var>YOURNAME</var>
      is your CCIS ID.
      Your repository will probably be empty when you clone it.
      Within your cloned repository, you should create a new
      directory named <code>set01</code>.
      All of the code you write for this problem set will go into
      that directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also need to download a copy of
      <a href="extras.rkt">
        <code>extras.rkt</code>
      </a>
      and put it in your <code>set01</code> directory along with
      the <code>q1.rkt</code> through <code>q5.rkt</code> files
      you will write for this problem set.
      Each of those files must import that library by including
      the lines
    </p>
    <pre>
      (require rackunit)
      (require "extras.rkt")
    </pre>
    <p>
      near the top of the file, preceded only by your comments
      describing the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately following those <code>require</code> declarations,
      your file should state a <code>provide</code> declaration for
      each deliverable function.  For example, your <code>q1.rkt</code>
      file should say
    </p>
    <pre>
      (provide cvolume)
      (provide csurface)
    </pre>
    <p>
      Those <code>provide</code> declarations allow our testing
      infrastructure to <code>require</code> your file and check
      to see whether you've provided all of the deliverable functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to follow the design recipe.  Your
      <a href="../Info/deliverables.html">
        deliverables
      </a>
      include the data definitions you need (including interpretations
      and templates), contracts, purpose statements, examples and tests,
      and design strategies in addition to your function definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to fill out a
      <a href="yourID-log.txt">
        work session report
      </a>
      at the end of each
      work session.  Tell <code>git</code> to <code>add</code> it to
      the files you will commit, and then commit and push that report
      in addition to committing and pushing your entire
      <code>set01</code> directory.  Do this at the end of every work
      session.
    </p>

      Do the following exercises from
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html">
        the textbook:
      </a>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Exercise 12 (<code>cvolume</code> and <code>csurface</code>).
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q1.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercise 14 (<code>string-last</code>).
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q2.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercise 19 (<code>string-insert</code>).
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q3.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercise 27 (refactoring the <code>profit</code> program).
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q4.rkt</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercise 38 (<code>string-remove-last</code>).
        Put your solution in a file named <code>q5.rkt</code>.
      </li>
