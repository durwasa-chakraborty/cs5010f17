      This is an individual assignment.  You are not allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the repository we created for you at the beginning
      of the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of every work session, you are required to update
      your log file to record the time you spent in that work session.
      (Please do not include the time you spent in any previous work
      sessions, as those times will already have been recorded in
      previous versions of your log file.)
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In this problem set, you will run several benchmarks
      and report your findings.
      You will run the benchmarks on a machine that has the
      following software installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the
        <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">
          Gnu C compiler
        </a>
        (<code>gcc</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html">
          Java 8
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        the ps11 interpreter you wrote in Problem Set 10
        and improved in Problem Set 11
      </li>
      <li>
        the
        <a href="http://www.cesura17.net/%7Elarcenists/Nightly/">
          Larceny
        </a>
        implementation of Scheme
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <code>gcc</code>, Java 8, and Larceny can be downloaded
      from the web sites linked above.
      If you are unable to install one or more of those systems
      on a machine you own or control, you can use one of the
      CCIS Linux machines in WVH 102.
      If you use one of the CCIS Linux machines, you will probably
      want to add <code>/course/cs5010sp17/bin</code> to your path
      so you can run <code>larceny</code> more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please do not run benchmarks on <code>login.ccs.neu.edu</code>.
      Many other students are using that server.
      They and the CCIS system staff will be annoyed if you run
      cpu-intensive benchmarks on that shared server.
      Because so many other students are using that server,
      any timings you obtain on that server would be unreliable
      anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first part of this problem set, you will run benchmarks
      that rely on non-tail recursion (<code>fib</code>) or
      tail recursion (<code>sumsq</code>), and you will translate
      one of those benchmarks into an equivalent Java program that
      uses idiomatic loops instead of tail recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second part of this problem set, you will run two
      benchmarks that were designed to measure the speed of
      storage allocation and deallocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your deliverables include the <code>Sumsq2.java</code> file
      you will complete in part 1, and a <code>report.txt</code> file
      that records the timings you measure in both parts.
      You will also write your answer to a popular question about
      explicit deallocation versus garbage collection.
    </p>

  <h3>
    Problem Specification
  </h3>
  <p>
    We are giving you a
    <a href="set12.tgz">
      <code>set12</code> directory
    </a>
    that contains several benchmarks, a tail-recursive
    <code>Sumsq2.java</code> program you will modify,
    and a <code>report.txt</code> file you will modify.
    Unpack that directory and push it to your GitHub repository.
    Add the interpreter your team wrote in
    Problem Sets 10 and 11 to that directory and push it again
    to your repository.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will then be ready to work on the following questions.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Modify <code>Sumsq2.java</code> as necessary to make it
      use loop syntax instead of tail recursion, but do not
      modify it any more than necessary.
      (In particular, do not use any mathematical formulas
      that would change its asymptotic running time.)
      Then run the benchmarks indicated for question 1
      in the <code>report.txt</code> file, and add the
      results you observe to that file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Run the benchmarks indicated for question 2
      in the <code>report.txt</code> file, and add the
      results you observe to that file.
      Then answer the question asked at the end of that file.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    After you have modified <code>Sumsq2.java</code>
    and completed <code>report.txt</code>, push your files
    to your repository.
