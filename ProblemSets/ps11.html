      This is a

        pair programming
      </a>
      assignment.  You are required to
      complete this problem set in collaboration with your assigned
      partner, but neither of you are allowed to
      discuss this problem set with any other person.  You are also
      not allowed to search for or to view any solutions to similar
      problems that may be available on the World-Wide Web or in
      other resources that might otherwise have been available to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have created a repository for you and your partner to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those repositories, we have created files named
      <code><em>ID1</em>-log.txt</code> and
      <code><em>ID2</em>-log.txt</code> for you to use when
      filing work session reports, as in previous problem sets.
      You and your partner are required to push your files at
      the end of every work session.
      (You <em>may</em> push your files several times during
      a work session, but we do not require you to do so.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of every work session, you are required to update
      your log file to record the time you spent in that work session.
      (Please do not include the time you spent in any previous work
      sessions, as those times will already have been recorded in
      previous versions of your log file.)
      If both of you work together during a work session, both of
      you must update your log files, recording only the time <em>you</em>
      spent working.  Do not include your partner's time in
      your log file, but be sure to push the updated versions of
      both log files.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In the first part of this problem set,
      you will define a <code>Programs.main</code> method
      that reads a <code>ps11</code> program from a file
      specified on the command line, parses that program,
      and runs it on one or more inputs specified on the
      command line, printing the result computed by the program.
      That should make it easier for you to finish debugging
      the interpreter you wrote in Problem Set 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second part of this problem set,
      you will implement a simple static analysis:
      given the name of a file containing a <code>ps11</code> program,
      return a set containing the names of all undefined variables
      that are referenced anywhere in the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must use Java 8 for this assignment.
      All of your code must reside within the default package.
      You may use/import anything in the
      <code>java.lang</code> and <code>java.util</code>
      packages,
      <ins>
        and you may import the specific things imported by
        the Java files we are giving you as a hint,
      </ins>
      but you are not allowed to use any other packages.

  <h3>
    Problem Specification
  </h3>
  <p>
    In Problem Set 10, you wrote an interpreter for
    a simple functional programming language.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Problem Set 11, we are going to change the concrete syntax
    <ins>
      by making semicolon a separator rather than a terminator, and
    </ins>
    by eliminating the <code>fi</code> token that terminated
    <code>if</code> expressions in the concrete syntax given
    in Problem Set 10.  For Problem Set 11, the concrete syntax is:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;pgm&gt;     ::=  &lt;defn&gt;
              ::=  &lt;defn&gt; ; &lt;pgm&gt;
    &lt;defn&gt;    ::=  &lt;id&gt; = &lt;const&gt;
              ::=  &lt;id&gt; (&lt;formals&gt;) &lt;expr&gt;
    &lt;const&gt;   ::=  true 
              ::=  false
              ::=  &lt;int&gt;
    &lt;lambda&gt;  ::=  (Î» ( &lt;formals&gt; ) &lt;expr&gt;)
    &lt;expr&gt;    ::=  &lt;const&gt;
              ::=  &lt;id&gt;
              ::=  &lt;lambda&gt;
              ::=  &lt;arith&gt;
              ::=  &lt;call&gt;
              ::=  &lt;if&gt;
              ::=  ( &lt;expr&gt; )
    &lt;arith&gt;   ::=  &lt;expr&gt; &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;
    &lt;call&gt;    ::=  &lt;expr&gt; (&lt;exprs&gt;)
    &lt;if&gt;      ::=  if &lt;expr&gt; then &lt;expr&gt; else &lt;expr&gt;
    
    &lt;op&gt;      ::=  &lt; | = | &gt; | + | - | *
    
    &lt;formals&gt;  ::=  &lt;id&gt;
               ::=  &lt;id&gt; , &lt;formals&gt;
    &lt;exprs&gt;    ::=  &lt;expr&gt;
               ::=  &lt;expr&gt; , &lt;exprs&gt;
    
    &lt;int&gt; and &lt;id&gt; are described by regular expressions:
    
        digit digit*
    
        letter (letter | digit)*
  </pre>
  <p>
    That change to the concrete syntax should not affect any code
    code you wrote for Problem Set 10, because your interpreter
    used abstract syntax, which remains the same in Problem Set 11.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concrete syntax we use will also allow comments, which
    start with the <code>#</code> character and extend through
    the end of the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    The context-free grammar shown above is ambiguous,
    but it can be converted into an unambiguous grammar
    that generates the same set of programs.
    The unambiguous grammar we will use as the official
    concrete syntax is the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">
      LL(1) grammar
    </a>
    given in the <code>cfg.pg</code> file within the
    <a href="set11parser.tgz">
      <code>set11parser</code> directory
    </a>
    we are giving you as a hint for part 1 of this problem set.
    That directory contains a <code>README</code> file that
    describes the files in that directory.
    You should read that README file before you start to work
    on this problem set.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    If you did a good job on Problem Set 10, this problem set
    will be easy.  If the interpreter you wrote for Problem Set 10
    had problems, this problem set will give you a chance to fix
    those problems.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Copy the program you wrote for Problem Set 11 into a
      directory named <code>set11</code>.
      Add a definition of the following public static method to
      the <code>Programs</code> class defined in your
      <code>Programs.java</code> file:
      <pre>
        // Runs the ps11 program found in the file named on the command line
        // on the integer inputs that follow its name on the command line,
        // printing the result computed by the program.
        //
        // Example:
        //
        //     % java Programs sieve.ps11 2 100
        //     25
        
        public static void main (String[] args) { ... }
      </pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        We are giving you a
        <a href="set11parser.tgz">
          directory of Java code
        </a>
        that contains a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">
          recursive descent parser
        </a>
        for <code>ps11</code> programs.
        The <code>Scanner</code> class defined in <code>Scanner.java</code>
        defines several public static methods you may find helpful.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a definition of the following public static method to
      the <code>Programs</code> class defined in your
      <code>Programs.java</code> file:
      <pre>
        // Reads the ps11 program found in the file named by the given string
        // and returns the set of all variable names that occur free within
        // the program.
        //
        // Examples:
        //     Programs.undefined ("church.ps11")    // returns an empty set
        //     Programs.undefined ("bad.ps11")       // returns { "x", "z" }
        //
        //   where bad.ps11 is a file containing:
        // 
        //     f (x, y) g (x, y) (y, z);
        //     g (z, y) if 3 > 4 then x else f
        
        public static Set&lt;String&gt undefined (String filename) { ... }
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
