    <ul>
      <li>
        Each method definition should have a contract that is the
        same as the contract in the interface.
        (In Java, the compiler enforces this.)
      </li>
      <li>
        A method may have a purpose statement that specializes
        the purpose statement given in the interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Methods should have examples as needed to clarify the
        purpose statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each method should have tests associated with it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Document your method with a strategy if that would help
        readers to understand the definition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Document your method with a halting measure if it is
        recursive and the halting measure isn't obvious.
      </li>
    </ul>
