    <ul>
      <li>
        A public method is a method whose definition begins
        with <code>public</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a method is listed in an interface, its definition
        must be public.
        (The Java compiler enforces this.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Every public method of the class
        <em>MUST</em> be listed in an interface the class
        implements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your class may also define non-public help methods.
        If a help method is called only from within the class,
        then it should be declared <code>private</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may write non-public help methods to be used only
        for testing.  Those methods cannot be private, unless
        the tests that call them are written within the class,
        but they should not be public.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your non-public methods should come after all of the
        public methods.
      </li>
    </ul>
