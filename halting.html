<h1>
Undecidability of the Halting Problem
</h1>

<p>
The undecidability of the halting problem is one of the
most interesting and important topics in computer science.
Indeed, it is one of the most important philosophical and
scientific discoveries made during the twentieth century.
</p>

<p>
The Scheme programming language, with its natural
representation of programs as structured data, allows
an especially simple yet rigorous treatment of this
topic.
We could use any other Turing-complete language instead,
but the definitions and proofs would become more complex.
</p>

<p>
We begin with some introductory material concerning quines
and Turing completeness.

<h2>
Quines
</h2>

<h4 class="center">
Definition of Quines
</h4>

<blockquote class="darker">
A Scheme program <code><var>Q</var></code> is a <em>quine</em>
if and only if
<pre class="darker">
    (equal? <var>Q</var>
            (eval <var>Q</var> (scheme-report-environment 5)))
</pre>
evaluates to <code>#t</code>.
</blockquote>

<p>
<code>0</code> is a quine.
</p>

<pre>
((lambda (x) (x x))
 (lambda (x) (x x)))
</pre>
<p>
is not a quine.
</p>

<pre>
((lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x)))
 '(lambda (x) (list x (list 'quote x))))
</pre>
<p>
is a quine.
</p>

<p>
If you don't understand why we are using Scheme
instead of some other language such as Java,
then you should write a Java program that prints itself to
<code>System.out</code>.
</p>

<p>
Quines are named after 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine">Willard
Van Orman Quine</a>, who used to teach philosophy at
Harvard.

<h2>
Turing Completeness
</h2>

<p>
Let N be the set of natural numbers (starting with zero).
</p>

<blockquote class="darker">
<strong>Theorem.</strong>
Not all mathematical functions from N to N are computable
by a Scheme program.
</blockquote>

<p>
The proof of that theorem uses a technique called <em>diagonalization</em>,
which we will also use when we prove the undecidability of
the halting problem.
</p>

<blockquote class="darker">
<strong>Proof.</strong>
Suppose every mathematical function <var>f</var>: N &rarr; N
were computed by some Scheme program <var>P<sub>f</sub></var>.
We will use the <var>P<sub>f</sub></var> to define a function
<var>g</var>: N &rarr; N that isn't computed by any of the
<var>P<sub>f</sub></var>.

<br />
<br />

First we assign a unique natural number to each of the
<var>P<sub>f</sub></var>.  One way to do this is to represent
each <var>P<sub>f</sub></var> by its UTF-8 encoding,
and to interpret the bits of that UTF-8 encoding as the binary
representation of a natural number <var>i<sub>f</sub></var>.

<br />
<br />

Define <var>g</var>: N &rarr; N as follows.  For each natural
number <var>i</var> that is not equal to any of the
<var>i<sub>f</sub></var>, define <var>g</var>(<var>i</var>) = 0.
For each <var>i<sub>f</sub></var>, define
<var>g</var>(<var>i<sub>f</sub></var>) = 
<var>f</var>(<var>i<sub>f</sub></var>) + 1.

<br />
<br />

<var>g</var> is not computed by any of the <var>P<sub>f</sub></var>
because it returns a different result when given <var>i<sub>f</sub></var>
as an argument.  Therefore the <var>P<sub>f</sub></var> didn't
compute all possible functions after all.
</blockquote>

<p>
Nothing in the proof depends upon any special properties
of Scheme.  We could prove the theorem for any other
programming language by substituting that language for
Scheme.
</p>

<p>
Some mathematical functions are computable, but not all
mathematical functions are computable.
It turns out that all sufficiently powerful programming
languages compute exactly the same set of functions from
N to N.
To make it easier to talk about the programming languages
that are sufficiently powerful to compute this standard
set of functions from N to N, we call them the
Turing-complete languages.
</p>

<h4 class="center">
Definition of Turing Completness
</h4>

<blockquote class="darker">
A programming language L is Turing-complete
if and only if
L is at least as powerful as Scheme in the following sense:
For every mathematical function <var>f</var>: N &rarr; N
that can be computed by a Scheme program, one could write
a program in L that also computes <var>f</var>.
</blockquote>

<p>
That definition could use any sufficiently powerful
programming language instead of Scheme, but Scheme is
convenient because it supports arbitrarily large exact
integers.
The original definition of Turing completeness used
Turing machines, which are much less convenient.

<h2>
Halting Problem for Scheme
</h2>

<blockquote class="darker">
<strong>Definition.</strong>
A lambda expression <code><var>H</var></code>
<em>solves the halting problem</em> for Scheme
if and only if
for all expressions <code><var>F</var></code>
and printable values <code><var>V</var></code>
<pre class="darker">
    (<var>H</var> '<var>F</var> '<var>V</var>)
</pre>
returns <code>#t</code>
if <code>(<var>F</var> '<var>V</var>)</code> terminates
and returns <code>#f</code>
if <code>(<var>F</var> '<var>V</var>)</code> does not terminate.
</blockquote>

<p>
The restriction to printable values might make
the halting problem easier, but it doesn't make
the problem any harder.
If the halting problem is undecidable when
restricted to printable values, then it is also
undecidable when all values are allowed.

<h2>
Undecidability of the Halting Problem for Scheme
</h2>

<blockquote class="darker">
<strong>Theorem.</strong>
No lambda expression <code><var>H</var></code>
solves the halting problem for Scheme.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="darker">
<strong>Proof.</strong>
Suppose <code><var>H</var></code> is a lambda expression,
and consider the following expression, which we'll call
<code><var>D</var></code>:
<pre class="darker">
    (let ()
      (define d (lambda (x) (if (<var>H</var> x x) (d x) #t)))
      d)
</pre>
If <code>(<var>H</var> '<var>D</var> '<var>D</var>)</code>
returns <code>#t</code>,
then <code>(<var>D</var> '<var>D</var>)</code> does not halt,
which means <code><var>H</var></code> does not solve the halting problem.

<br />
<br />

If <code>(<var>H</var> '<var>D</var> '<var>D</var>)</code>
returns <code>#f</code>,
then <code>(<var>D</var> '<var>D</var>)</code> returns <code>#t</code>,
which means <code><var>H</var></code> does not solve the halting problem.

<br />
<br />

If <code>(<var>H</var> '<var>D</var> '<var>D</var>)</code>
returns any value other than <code>#t</code> or <code>#f</code>,
then <code><var>H</var></code> does not solve the halting problem.

<br />
<br />

If <code>(<var>H</var> '<var>D</var> '<var>D</var>)</code>
does not return,
then <code><var>H</var></code> does not solve the halting problem.

<br />
<br />

Since <code>(<var>H</var> '<var>D</var> '<var>D</var>)</code>
must do one of the four things above,
<code><var>H</var></code> does not solve the halting problem.

<br />
<br />

Since <code><var>H</var></code>
is an arbitrary lambda expression, we conclude that no lambda
expression solves the halting problem for Scheme.
</blockquote>

<p>
It's a lot easier to prove the undecidability of the halting
problem for Scheme than for most other languages,
but the theorem above and its proof can be stated and proved for
any Turing-complete programming language by encoding programs
and values as numbers (or by using the quine tricks)
to turn any program
<code><var>H</var></code> into a program
<code><var>D</var></code> that loops forever if
<code><var>H</var></code> says it halts, and halts if
<code><var>H</var></code> says it doesn't halt.
