    <p>
      The fairness of that translation might be a little controversial
      because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It uses fixnum-only arithmetic instead of Scheme's usual
        generic arithmetic.
      </li>
      <li>
        It measures only the time consumed by the call to
        <code>ack</code>, excluding the time needed to compile this program
        and to load the libraries it uses.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using fixnum arithmetic might be fair because C and Java
      aren't using generic arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excluding compilation time might be fair because we're
      going to exclude compilation time for C and Java when
      we run the benchmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excluding the time needed to load libraries might be
      fair because the C version links the needed libraries
      into an executable ahead of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we time the Java version, however, we won't link the
      libraries into an executable ahead of time.
      If you use inputs that make this benchmark run for only
      a few seconds, that will be unfair to Java.
      With this particular benchmark, however, using inputs
      that would make the Java version run for more than a
      few seconds would generate a stack overflow, which
      might look worse than a slow running time.
      What's fair?
