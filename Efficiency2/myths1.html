    Efficiency and Other Myths

    <p>
      This module examines the impact of programming style,
      programming languages, and language implementation on
      efficiency.
      These matters are largely unrelated to algorithmic complexity,
      so they are seldom discussed in courses on algorithms and data
      structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programmers often form opinions based on what they
      have heard from other programmers or have read on the
      World-Wide Web.
      Much of that conventional wisdom is misleading or, in some cases,
      quite wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main goal of this module is to encourage you to adopt
      a more skeptical and empirical approach to what you may
      hear or read.
