    Summary
  </h3>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An expression is in tail context if its value
        will be returned immediately following its
        evaluation.
      </li>
      <li>
        A tail call is a function or method call that appears
        in a tail context.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether tail calls are faster and more space-efficient
        than non-tail calls depends on the implementation of
        your programming language.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the implementation is properly tail recursive,
        tail calls are more space-efficient than
        non-tail calls, and will probably be faster as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the implementation is not properly tail recursive,
        but performs tail call optimization, a tail call might
        be more efficient than a non-tail call, but you can't
        rely on that.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some programming languages, notably Scheme, require
        implementations to be properly tail recursive.
      </li>
      <li>
        In most implementations of most programming languages,
        tail calls are implemented so inefficiently
        that tail calls are just as slow and consume just as
        much space as non-tail calls.
      </li>
      <li>
        The inefficiency of those implementations is unlikely
        to be fixed in the near future.
      </li>
      <li>
        In languages such as Java or C, whose implementations are
        not properly tail recursive and may not even perform
        tail call optimization, you'll need to rewrite
        performance-sensitive tail calls using special loop
        syntax.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rewriting tail calls to use special syntax for loops
        is not always possible, because the special syntax
        is usually confined to a single function or method body.
        With tail recursion, loops can cross function/method
        boundaries.
      </li>
