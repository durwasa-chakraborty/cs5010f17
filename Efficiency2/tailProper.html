  <h3>
    Proper Tail Recursion
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Compilers and interpreters that use the more efficient
      technique for <strong><em>all</em></strong> tail calls
      are said to be <em>properly tail recursive</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standards for some programming languages, such as Scheme,
      require implementations of the language to be
      properly tail recursive.
      There are a few other languages, such as Standard ML,
      whose implementations are properly tail recursive
      even though their language specifications do not
      explicitly require them to be properly tail recursive.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using a properly tail recursive implementation
      of your programming language, then you can be sure the
      tail calls in your programs are implemented in the more
      efficient way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using an implementation that performs tail call
      optimization, you can only hope your tail calls are being
      implemented efficiently.
      Some of them probably are, but others probably aren't.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using Java or some other language that makes
      proper tail recursion difficult, you can be sure your
      tail calls are being implemented inefficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time in history, most compilers and interpreters
      for most programming languages implement tail calls
      inefficiently.
