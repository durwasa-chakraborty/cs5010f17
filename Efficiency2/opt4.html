    What Do You Gain By Writing Ugly Code?

  <div>
    <p>
      I wrote a benchmark that calls <code>ip</code>
      one million times on arrays of length 1000.
      I ran both the Java and C versions of that benchmark
      on a Linux machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Java version of the benchmark printed its result
      almost instantly.  Its running time was
      dominated by the time required to load and run the JVM.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I used <code>gcc</code> to compile the ugly code,
      without optimization,
      the computation took several seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I used <code>gcc -O4</code> to compile the ugly code,
      the computation took too little time to measure.
