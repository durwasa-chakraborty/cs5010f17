  <h3>
    Generational Garbage Collection
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Generational garbage collectors allocate all small objects
      in a region of memory called the <em>nursery</em>.
      When the nursery fills up, they move reachable objects
      out of the nursery into another area of memory,
      reclaiming the entire nursery all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those <em>minor collections</em> take time proportional
      to the reachable storage within the nursery, because
      the collector touches only the reachable objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explicit deallocation touches all of the objects whose
      storage is being reclaimed, so explicit deallocation
      takes time proportional to the storage that is about
      to become unreachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      With our naive micro-benchmark, the reachable storage
      averages about 500 objects, which occupy a very small
      fraction of the nursery.
      If the nursery is large enough to hold a million list
      nodes, which is fairly typical, the garbage collector
      touches only 1 out of every 2000 objects that are
      allocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explicit deallocation has to touch every object that's
      allocated.  That's the main reason why it runs so much
      slower on this micro-benchmark.
