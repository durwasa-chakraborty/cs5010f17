    Ackermann's Function

  <div>
    <p>
      When benchmarking, we need programs and inputs that run
      long enough for us to measure the running time accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      For micro-benchmarks, the running time is likely to be too
      small to measure accurately unless the inputs are large or
      the algorithm's running time is polynomial of high degree,
      exponential, or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can measure the running time of a fast program more
      accurately by running it many times, but we have to be
      careful lest the overhead of that loop dominates the
      running time we are trying to measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That explains why ridiculously inefficient algorithms,
      such as the obvious doubly recursive computation of
      Fibonacci numbers, are often used in micro-benchmarks
      or test programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A doubly recursive computation of Fibonacci numbers
      runs in exponential time.
      Exponential time is much faster than the running time
      needed for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">
        Ackermann's function,
      </a>
      which was the first example ever discovered of a
      mathematical function that is not primitive recursive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The C program shown below is one of the Kernighan and Van Wyk
      micro-benchmarks.  It computes Ackermann's function.

    <pre>
      #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
      
      int ack(int m, int n) {
          if (m == 0)
              return n+1;
          else if (n == 0)
              return ack(m-1, 1);
          else
              return ack(m-1, ack(m, n-1));
      }
      
      int main(int argc, char **argv)
      {
          int m = 3, n = 9;
      
          if (argc &gt; 1)
              m = atoi(argv[1]);
          if (argc &gt; 2)
              n = atoi(argv[2]);
          printf("%d\n", ack(m, n));
          return 0;
      }
