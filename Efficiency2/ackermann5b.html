      What did you learn from these numbers?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Did you learn that optimized C code runs 10 times as
        fast as unoptimized C code?
      </li>
      <li>
        Did you learn that unoptimized compiled ps11
        runs faster than unoptimized compiled C?
      </li>
      <li>
        Did you learn that Scheme runs faster than Java?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        You should not have learned those things.
      </strong>
      If you didn't already know that optimized C code is often
      faster than unoptimized code, or that ps11 programs might
      sometimes run faster than an equivalent C program, or that
      Scheme might sometimes run faster than Java,
      or that Scheme's generic arithmetic might be faster than
      fixnum arithmetic in some systems,
      then you might have learned something from the table above.
      Beyond that, there isn't much to learn from that table.

      You would do well to remember what Kernighan and Van Wyk wrote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There seems to be little hope of predicting performance in
        other than a most general way; if there is a single clear
        conclusion, it is that no benchmark result should ever be
        taken at face value.
