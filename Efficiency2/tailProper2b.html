      That is, to be sure, a silly function/method.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Java programmer would ever write that kind of
      code.  Why wouldn't they write that kind of code?
      Because implementations of Java aren't properly tail recursive,
      so that kind of code is horribly inefficient in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      That kind of code is not horribly inefficient in languages
      that require proper tail recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If proper tail recursion mattered only for silly programs,
      it wouldn't matter very much.
      As our next example will show, proper tail recursion also
      matters for serious programs written in a natural
      object-oriented style.
