  <h3>
    Why Proper Tail Recursion Matters
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Interpreters for general purpose programming languages are
      serious programs.
      In particular, the interpreters we wrote for <code>ps11</code>
      are serious programs.
      As you have seen from the <code>sieve</code>
      and <code>vectors</code> example programs,
      <code>ps11</code> is powerful enough to define structured
      data types.
      With a few extensions to its concrete syntax, a type checker,
      and a way to call library routines written in another language,
      <code>ps11</code> would be more than competitive with languages
      such as Python.
      All of that could be added without making any changes to the
      <code>ps11</code> interpreters we've already written.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can therefore use those interpreters as examples of
      serious Java programs that would benefit from proper tail
      recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's use the <code>sieve.ps11</code> program as a benchmark
      to compare the performance of one of those interpreters,
      written in Java, to a <code>ps11</code> compiler (also written
      in Java) that generates Scheme code, which can then be
      executed by any implementation of the current Scheme standard.
