    <p>
      When we want to focus on the efficiency of some particular
      language feature or programming style, as opposed to the
      overall efficiency of some large and complicated program,
      we often use small <em>micro-benchmarks</em>.
      Because they are small, we can design them to emphasize
      the particular feature or style of interest.
      Because they are small, it is easier to avoid confounding
      problems.
      Because they are small, it is easier for programmers to
      read them when deciding whether the comparison is
      fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The danger of micro-benchmarks is that, being small, they
      are not representative of typical programs.
      It would be a mistake to say compiler A is better than
      compiler B on the basis on one micro-benchmark, or even
      several micro-benchmarks.
      It would be a mistake to say language X is faster than
      language Y on the basis on one micro-benchmark, or even
      several micro-benchmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      By design, micro-benchmarks can only tell us about the
      language feature or programming style whose efficiency
      they were designed to measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many micro-benchmarks don't even do that.
