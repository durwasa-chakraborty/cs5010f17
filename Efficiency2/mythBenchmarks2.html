    Cross-language Benchmarks
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Cross-language benchmarks are especially fraught when
      they are intended to determine which programming language
      is more efficient for some particular purpose or task.
    </p>
    <p>
      The efficiency you measure can easily depend upon small
      and seemingly minor details of how the programs are written.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the programs were written specifically as benchmarks,
      how do you know their efficiency will be relevant to any
      real-world computing task?
    </p>
    <p>
      When a program written in one language is translated into
      another language for the purpose of benchmarking, how do
      you know the translation was done fairly?
    </p>
    <p>
      For that matter, what does <em>fair</em> even mean in this
      context?
      When translating a Java program that uses mutable lists
      into Scheme, is it fair to use immutable lists in Scheme?
      When translating a Scheme program that uses immutable
      lists into Java, is it fair to use mutable lists in Java?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to be fair when translating any benchmark from
      one language into another, and it is especially hard with
      large benchmarks.  Larger benchmarks create more opportunities
      for unfair translation.
