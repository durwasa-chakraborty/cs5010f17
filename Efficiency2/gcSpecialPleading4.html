        Garbage collectors periodically stop the program so they
        can recycle storage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Explicit deallocation of large data structures also stops
      the program to recycle storage.
      Those pauses often last longer than they would with garbage
      collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to pause times, the main advantage of
      explicit deallocation over automatic garbage collection
      is that programmers can avoid explicit deallocation of
      large, multi-object data structures during program phases
      where long pauses would be disruptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many garbage collectors provide an API that allows the
      collector to be invoked explicitly at times when those
      pauses would be less disruptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In programs where pauses would be completely intolerable,
      the standard practice is to allocate all necessary storage
      at the beginning of the program, recycling none of it.
      That technique works with garbage collection as well as
      it does with explicit deallocation.  Since no storage is
      allocated following initialization, the garbage collector
      never runs.
