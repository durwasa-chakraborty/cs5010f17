  <h3>
    The <code>MPermNKL</code> Benchmark
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The <code>GCBench</code> benchmark was designed to be
      representative of real applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>MPermNKL</code> benchmark was designed to be
      a near-worst-case for generational garbage collection.

    <p>
      On the fastest machines, Java generally outperforms
      C, but C is more likely to outperform Java on the slowest
      machines, especially when Java is limited to 500 megabytes
      of heap memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?  I am not certain, but I think that correlation between
      faster machines and superior performance by Java is caused,
      at least in part, by the fact that the faster machines tend
      to offer more processor cores.  The benchmark itself is
      single-threaded, but Oracle's JVM takes advantage of multiple
      cores during garbage collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that garbage collectors can exploit multiple
      processor cores even when the application is single-threaded
      constitutes a third performance advantage of garbage collection
      over explicit deallocation.
