    The <code>MPermNKL</code> Benchmark

  <div>
    <p>
      The <code>GCBench</code> benchmark was designed to be
      representative of real applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>MPermNKL</code> benchmark was designed to be
      a near-worst-case for generational garbage collection.

    <p>
      As mentioned above, this benchmark was designed as a
      near-worst-case for generational garbage collection.
      That is one of the reasons why Larceny's non-generational
      stop-and-copy collector usually performs better than the
      other systems tested, except on the fastest machines where
      Java's ability to exploit extra processor cores becomes more
      important than generational versus non-generational
      collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason is that Larceny's non-generational collector
      was allowed to use more memory than Larceny's generational
      collector, but not as much memory as Java uses by default.
