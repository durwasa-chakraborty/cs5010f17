  <h3>
    Tail Calls in Java
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      A method call is a tail call if and only if it occurs in
      a tail context.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Intuition:
      </strong>
      There are two ways to implement a tail call.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The inefficient way is to have the tail call return its value
        to this method, which immediately returns that value to its caller.
      </li>
      <li>
        The more efficient way is to have the tail call return that value
        directly to the caller of this method, so this method doesn't
        have to wait around just so it can pass it along.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The more efficient technique can be implemented by arranging for
      this method to pass the return address it was given to the
      method it's calling, instead of creating a brand new return
      address that points to machine code whose only job is to
      return to the given return address.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Example:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <pre>
      return x.toString();
    </pre>
    <p>
      The call to the <code>toString()</code> method of <code>x</code>
      is a tail call.
      The method in which that call appears could wait around for
      the string to be returned, at which time the method would just
      pass that string on to the return address it was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be more efficient for the method in which that call
      appears to pass the return address it was given along to the
      <code>toString()</code> method, so the <code>toString()</code>
      method could return its string directly to the ultimate
      consumer of that string.
