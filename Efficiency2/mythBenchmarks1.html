    Benchmarks
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Determining which of two programs is more efficient sounds
      straightforward:
      Run both programs on identical inputs, and see which is
      faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      We refer to such comparisons as <em>benchmarking</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benchmarking isn't as simple as it sounds.
      For one thing, what inputs should you use?
      One program might be faster on some inputs,
      but the other program might be faster on other inputs.
      Running the programs on just one set of inputs might
      give you a misleading impression of their relative
      efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if both programs are written in the same programming
      language, the interpreter or compiler you use when comparing
      them might also affect the results.
      It is not uncommon for one program to run faster when both are
      interpreted, but for the other program to run faster when both are
      compiled.
      The specific compiler you use can also make a difference.
      Program X might run faster than program Y when both are
      compiled by compiler A, but Y might be faster when both
      are compiled by compiler B.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the programs whose efficiency you wish to compare are
      written in different programming languages, benchmarking
      becomes even more problematic.
      Most obviously, you can't use the same interpreter or
      compiler to run all of the programs.
