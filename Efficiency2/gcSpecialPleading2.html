        These benchmarks are unfair because
        <code>malloc/free</code> and <code>new/delete</code>,
        as implemented in C and C++, are very slow.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Yes, they're slow.  That's sort of the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other allocators and deallocators are available,
      just as other garbage collectors are available.
      In these benchmarks, we timed the default allocator
      and deallocator used by <code>gcc</code>, just as we
      timed the default garbage collectors used by Oracle's
      JVM and by Larceny.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one benchmark, we also timed Larceny's non-generational
      collector.
      We did that primarily to show how that one benchmark
      was designed to make generational garbage collectors
      perform poorly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came as a surprise to me that the generational
      collectors often out-performed explicit deallocation
      even on a benchmark that had been designed to make
      generational collectors look bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is entirely possible that alternative allocators
      and deallocators for C and C++ might perform better,
      on at least some of these benchmarks, than the default
      implementations we timed.
      In like manner, all of the garbage collectors we timed
      can be tuned to perform better on specific benchmarks.
