    Tail Call Optimization
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The C# language is similar to Java, but its specification
      does not preclude efficient implementation of tail calls,
      and the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) supports
      a directive compilers can attach to a specific tail call
      that has the effect of asking native code generators
      to use the more efficient technique for that tail call.
      Native code generators are free to ignore that request,
      but some of them do generate the more efficient code when
      doing so is sufficiently easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A compiler that uses the more efficient technique for tail
      calls when doing so is sufficiently easy is said to perform
      <em>tail call optimization</em>.
