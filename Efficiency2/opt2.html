    Compiler Optimization
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Compiler optimization is the process of translating a program so
      it runs faster than the obvious translation would run.
    </p>
    <p>
      What counts as an optimization is somewhat subjective, because
      it depends on what you think the obvious translation would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      With only a few exceptions, compiler optimizations do not change
      the asymptotic running time or asymptotic space efficiency of a
      program.  Compiler optimization usually improves performance by
      only a small constant factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small constant factors sometimes matter, but the main reason for
      using an optimizing compiler is that it saves you from worrying
      about the micro-efficiency of your programs.
