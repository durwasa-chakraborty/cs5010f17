  <h3>
    Proper Tail Recursion is About Space Efficiency
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The space efficiency of proper tail recursion is closely
      related to the following fact:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Garbage collection is asymptotically more space-efficient
        than stack allocation.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some programmers may be surprised by that, but the reason
      for it is easy to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With any reasonable garbage collector, the amount of
      memory devoted to objects that are unreachable is always
      bounded by a small multiple of the memory devoted to
      objects that are reachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an object is allocated on a stack, it will remain
      allocated so long as the stack frame remains allocated,
      even after there are no more references to the object.
      With stack allocation of objects, it is easy to construct
      examples for which the memory occupied by objects on the
      stack grows without bound while the memory occupied by
      reachable objects remains constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst-case space efficiency of stack allocation
      is therefore asymptotically worse than the worst-case
      space efficiency of garbage collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In like manner, the worst-case space efficiency of
      implementations that are not properly tail recursive
      is asymptotically worse than the worst-case space
      efficiency of otherwise identical but properly tail
      recursive implementations.
      We have already given an example of that,
      and the general theorem is not too hard to prove
      mathematically.
