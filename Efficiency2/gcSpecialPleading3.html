    <ul>
      <li>
        Real C/C++ programmers don't rely on
        <code>malloc/free</code> or <code>new/delete</code>.
        They write custom allocators instead.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, real programmers did their own register
      allocation and wrote their own storage overlays.
      Those tasks have been automated.
      Compilers now do a better job of register allocation than
      most programmers ever did.  On general purpose machines
      that run more than one process at a time, virtual memory
      usually works better than anything an application programmer
      could write, because it can take the behavior of other
      processes into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      For sufficiently simple programs such as our micro-benchmarks,
      it is not unusual for a custom allocator to outperform
      both garbage collection and non-custom explicit deallocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The custom allocator I wrote for the <code>MPermNKL</code>
      benchmark provides an example of this.
      That custom allocator/deallocator also accounts for over
      a hundred lines of code in
      a small program that, when written in Java, contains
      less than 250 lines of non-comment code.
      Furthermore, that custom allocator/deallocator is not
      an example of beautiful code.
      It is ugly, hard to understand, hard to debug, and hard
      to modify.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garbage collectors are also notoriously hard to debug
      and to modify.
      Once you've written and debugged a garbage collector,
      however, hundreds of thousands of programmers can use it
      in millions of programs.
