    GCBench

  <div>
    <p>
      We now turn to a micro-benchmark that was designed to be
      "more representative of real applications".
      The benchmark was written in Java by John Ellis and Pete Kovac,
      modified by Hans Boehm, and translated by Will Clinger
      into C, C++, and Scheme.
      Many implementors have used this benchmark to tune their
      garbage collectors and storage allocators.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring 2017 edition of CS 5010, Problem Set 12
      asked students to report results for this benchmark.
      Four of the timings they reported were outliers that
      would have had the effect of compressing the other
      data points into a small area of the plot, so those
      outliers have been omitted.
      All other timings are plotted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every student reported a slower time for C
      (as compiled by <code>gcc</code> and using its default
      implementation of <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>)
      than for Oracle's JVM with its default garbage collector
      and parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling Java to use at most 64 megabytes of heap storage
      didn't have much effect on the timings.
