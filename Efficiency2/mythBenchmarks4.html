    Kernighan and Van Wyk Benchmarks
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      To illustrate some of the issues that can arise when
      benchmarking, we will start with a micro-benchmark
      written by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">
        Brian Kernighan.
      </a>

        (Kernighan was an early contributor to Unix and a designer
        of the AWK and AMPL
        programming languages; his last name is the K in AWK.
        Kernighan was also a co-author of
        <cite>The C Programming Language</cite>,
        which programmers often cite as "Kernighan and Ritchie".)

      In 1998, Kernighan and Christopher J Van Wyk published
      a paper based on a small set of micro-benchmarks they
      had translated into various programming languages
      including C, AWK, and Scheme.
      From their abstract:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        ....We found enormous variation in performance, depending on
        many factors, some uncontrollable and even unknowable.
        There seems to be little hope of predicting performance in
        other than a most general way; if there is a single clear
        conclusion, it is that no benchmark result should ever be
        taken at face value. A few general principles hold:
      </p>
      <p>
        Compiled code usually runs faster than interpreted code:
        the more a program has been ‘compiled’ before it is
        executed, the faster it will run.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memory-related issues and the effects of memory hierarchies
        are pervasive: how memory is managed, from hardware caches
        to garbage collection, can change runtimes dramatically....
      </p>
      <p>
        ....We encountered more than a few bugs, size limitations,
        maladroit features, and total mysteries.
      </p>
