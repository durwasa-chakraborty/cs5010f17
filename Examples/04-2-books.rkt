;; An Author is represented as a String (any string will do)
;; later on, we might refine this definition

;; A Title is represented as a String (any string will do)

;; An International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is represented as a
;; positive integer (PosInt).

;; Actually, an ISBN is a sequence of exactly 13 digits, divided into
;; four fields (see
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number).
;; We don't need to represent all this information, so we will simply
;; represent it as a PosInt.

;; A DollarAmount is represented as an integer,
;; INTERP:  the amount in USD*100.
;; eg: the integer 3679 represents the dollar amount $36.79
;; A DollarAmount may be negative.

;; A BookStatus is represented as
;; (make-book-status isbn author title cost price on-hand)

;; INTERP:
;; isbn   : ISBN          -- the ISBN of the book
;; author : Author        -- the book's author
;; title  : Title         -- the book's title
;; cost   : DollarAmount  -- the wholesale cost of the book (how much
;;                           the bookstore paid for each copy of the
