;; COMMENTARY: remember that there are lots of functions with contract
;; Radius Radius -> Area.  Let's look at a few:

;; STRATEGY: combine simpler functions
(define (area-of-ring1 inner outer)
  (+ (area-of-circle inner) (area-of-circle outer)))

;; area-of-ring1 satisfies the contract for area-of-ring, but not its
;; purpose statement.  The purpose of the purpose statement is to
;; enable us to distinguish correct definitions from incorrect ones.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; Some function definitions are correct, but are bad because they are
;; unclear or too complicated.  Let's look at some examples:

;; STRATEGY: transcribe formula
(define (area-of-ring2 inner outer)
  (- (* pi outer outer) (* pi inner inner)))

;; area-of-ring2 is probably OK, but some TA is likely to say that you
;; have duplicated code ((* pi outer outer) and (* pi inner inner))
;; that you should move into a common help function.  Our original
;; area-of-ring is probably better.

(define (area-of-ring3 inner outer)
  (* pi (- (* outer outer) (* inner inner))))

;; area-of-ring3 needs some explanation; it doesn't seem obvious, at
;; least to me.  Remember: your job is to make the program as easy as
;; possible for the reader to understand.
