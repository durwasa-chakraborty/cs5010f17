      Module Overview
    </h3>
    <p>
      During this first week of class, while you might still be
      working on
      <a href="../ProblemSets/ps00.html">
        Problem Set 00</a>
      and the rest of your
      <a href="../Info/checklist.html">
        pre-semester checklist</a>,
      Module 00 will give you an introduction to the course
      and to the Design Recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        This course is not calculus.
      </strong>
      It's not about getting the right answer,
      because programming problems have many right answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        This course is about writing clear, readable, even beautiful
        programs.
      </strong>
      Lesson 0.1 presents the goals of this course
      and the principles we will use to achieve those goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      This course is organized differently from most courses you have taken.
      Lesson 0.2 explains how this course is organized
      and what you should expect.
      Lesson 0.3 deals with Academic Honesty,
      what counts as cheating in this course,
      what happens to students who are caught cheating,
      and why industry doesn't want to hire students who cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lessons 0.4 and 0.5 introduce you to the various systems
      we will use&mdash;most notably
      <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org/">
        Racket</a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.ccs.neu.edu/">
        GitHub</a>.
