  <h3>
    The <code>IMapBase&lt;K,V&gt;</code> Class
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The purpose statement for the
      <code>IMapBase&lt;K,V&gt;</code> class
      tells programmers what they have to do when defining
      subclasses that inherit from it:
    </p>
    <pre>
      // Abstract base class for classes that implement IMap&lt;K,V&gt; or SortedIMap&lt;K,V&gt;.
      //
      // To define a class that implements IMap&lt;K,V&gt;:
      //     make that class a subclass of this base class
      //     within that class, define the following abstract methods:
      //         public    IMap&lt;K,V&gt;   extend(K key, V value)
      //         protected boolean     hasKey(K key)
      //         protected V           getVal(K key)
      //         protected Iterator&lt;K&gt; keyIterator()
      //     within that class, override the following methods:
      //         public    int         size()
      //
      // To define a class that implements SortedIMap&lt;K,V&gt;:
      //     make that class a subclass of SortedIMapBase&lt;K,V&gt;
      //     define or override the methods listed above
      //     define comparator()
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <code>public</code> methods are listed by one or more
      interfaces, so they have to be public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>protected</code> methods are abstract help methods
      that shouldn't be called outside of the base class
      and its subclasses.
      That's why they aren't public.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Access Modifiers
    </h4>
    <p>
      In Java, <code>protected</code> is an access modifier with
      the remarkable property that declaring a method to be
      <code>protected</code> makes it <em>less</em> protected than if
      no access modifier had been written at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no access modifier had been written at all,
      the methods would not be accessible outside of the package
      in which the base class is defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want those methods to be accessible in all subclasses
      of the base class.
      To accomplish that, we need to make them less protected.
      Declaring them to be <code>protected</code> makes them less
      protected: they become accessible in all subclasses, even
      in subclasses defined outside of the package in which the
      base class is defined.
