    Inefficiencies

  <div>
    <p>
      The predefined <code>AbstractMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code> base class
      made it a lot easier to implement an
      <code>Imap&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface that inherits all of the
      methods listed in
      <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code>, but we paid a price in efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the operations we inherit from
      <code>AbstractMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code> are implemented in that
      class by calling the abstract
      <code>entrySet</code> method we defined in our
      <code>IMapList&lt;K,V&gt;</code> subclass.
    </p>
    <p>
      That means all of the inherited methods have to create
      a new object of the <code>IMapListSet&lt;K,V&gt;</code> subclass.
      Creating that object is done in O(1) time,
      but it's still slightly annoying that we have to create
      a new object for every <code>get</code> operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, the <code>extend</code> and <code>size</code> operations
      have to traverse the entire list of entries.
      If there are n entries in the <code>IMap</code>,
      that takes &Theta;(n) time.
      We ought to be able to make at least one of those operations
      run in O(1) time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could do that using our current representation, but
      we'd have to override more methods.
      The problem is that <code>entrySet</code> returns a
      <code>Set</code>, which means there can't be any duplicates,
      which means the <code>extend</code> operation has to
      traverse all of the entries looking to see whether the new
      key is already present in some entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we want <code>extend</code> to run in O(1) time,
      by adding a new entry at the front of the list without
      checking to see whether the key of that entry already
      appears in some other entry of the list.
      If we do that, we face an unpleasant choice between these
      two design strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Redefine <code>entrySet</code> so it removes duplicate keys.
        That makes essentially all of the inherited methods run in
        &Omega;(n) time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Override almost all of the methods
        we're inheriting from <code>AbstractMap</code>
        so they won't have to call <code>entrySet</code>.
        That's a lot of work.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we're going to do that much work, we might as well try
      to use a potentially more efficient representation
      while we're at it.
      That's the next lesson.
