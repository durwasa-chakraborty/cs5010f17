<h1>The Luggage Scanner Problem</h1>

<p>Your task is to design a program that determines whether a suitcase
will fit through an X-ray scanner at the airport.
</p>

<p>We assume the suitcase is a rectangular solid, and the mouth of the
X-ray machine is a rectangle.  We also assume that it doesn't matter how
long the suitcase is, so long as there is some way to feed it through
the scanner.  However, the suitcase must be inserted flat on the belt:
 no diagonals allowed.</p>

<p>Here is the contract and purpose statement:</p>

<pre>
suitcase-fits-scanner : Suitcase XRayMachine -> Boolean
GIVEN: a Suitcase and an XRayMachine
RETURNS: true iff the suitcase can fit through the X-ray machine.
</pre>
