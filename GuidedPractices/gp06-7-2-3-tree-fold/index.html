<h1>Guided Practice 6.7: Fancier Tree Fold</h1>

<p>
Recall the data type from Guided Practice 5.1, consisting of trees
with numbers in the leaves and with two kinds of interior nodes: one
kind with two sons and one kind with three sons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a fold function for these trees. </li>

  <li>Using your fold function, write leaf-max for these trees.</li>

  <li> Using your fold function, write a function double-all that takes one of these
  trees and returns a tree of the same shape in which all the leaves
  are doubled.  (This is the same as in Guided Practice 5.1).</li>

</ol>


<p><a href="solution.rkt" >[ANSWER]</a></p> (Remember, you won't get
anything about of this exercise unless you actually write the code and
test it.)
