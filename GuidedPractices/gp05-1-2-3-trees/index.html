<h1>Guided Practice 5.1: A Different Kind of Tree</h1>

<p>Consider a data structure of trees that have leaves with numbers in
them, and two kinds of interior nodes: one kind with two sons and the
other kind with three sons.  Here's an example: 
</p>

<img src="figure1.jpg" width="600px" alt="example tree">

<p>These trees are similar, but not identical to what are usually called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-3_tree" >2-3 trees</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a data definition for these trees. </li>

  <li>Write leaf-max for these trees.</li>

  <li> Write a function double-all that takes one of these
  trees and returns a tree of the same shape in which all the leaves
  are doubled.  For example, double-all applied to the tree above
  should return the tree</li>

<img src="figure2.jpg" width="600px" alt="example tree">

</ol>

anything about of this exercise unless you actually write the code and
test it.)
