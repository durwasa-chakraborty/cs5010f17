  <h2>
    Patterns of Communication Between Objects
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      In this module, we will consider objects with mutable state.
      We sometimes refer to mutable objects as <em>stateful</em> objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects can communicate in two basic ways:
      pull and push.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the functional paradigm, we used pull-style communication:
      Active objects (functions) ask other objects (functions
      and data structures) to give them information they need.
    </p>
    <p>
      With stateful objects, some patterns of push-style communication
      become easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Publish-subscribe</em> is a common pattern of
      push-style communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Delegates</em> are a refinement of publish-subscribe.
