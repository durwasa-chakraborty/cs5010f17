  <p>
    For each question of a problem set, your solution needs to
    include the following items.
  </p>
  <ul class="clear">
    <li>
    For each data definition:<p></p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>
          A set of <code>struct</code> definitions, if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <em>constructor template</em> that specifies how to
          build values for this data definition.  
        </li>
        <li>
          An <em>interpretation</em> that explains the meaning
          of each element of the data in terms of the information
          it represents.  That meaning should be the meaning of
          the data, not some description of how the data are used
          in the program.
        </li>
        <li>
          An <em>observer template</em> for examining values of
          this kind of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Examples, if they help readers to understand the
          interpretation, or for use in tests.
          If the examples are primarily for use in tests, you may
          place them near the tests.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      For each function:<p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Contract:
          </strong>
          a specification of data types for the arguments
          and for the result.
          If you write
          <pre>
list-numbered : ListOfNumber Number -> ListOfNumber
</pre>
          then your function must take <em>any</em> list of numbers
          and <em>any</em> number and produce the output specified
          by the purpose statement, unless the contract is qualified
          by a precondition or invariant (WHERE clause).
          We will talk about WHERE clauses in Module 07.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Purpose Statement:
          </strong>
          short noun phrases describing the arguments and what the
          function is supposed to return.
          Typically phrased in terms of information, not data.
          Purpose statements are usually stated in GIVEN/WHERE/RETURNS
          style, where each of those keywords is followed by a short
          noun phrase.
          Examples:
          <pre>
GIVEN: a temperature in Fahrenheit
RETURNS: the corresponding temperature in Celsius

GIVEN: a Cat c and a Scene s
RETURNS: A scene like s, except the cat c has been painted on it.

GIVEN: a list of numbers lon and a number n
WHERE: n = (length lon)
RETURNS: a list of numbers like lon, except each number is
multiplied by its distance from the end of the list.
</pre>
          You may omit the GIVEN part by referring to the given
          arguments in the RETURNS part.
          Sometimes this is easier than writing the GIVENS part
          separately, but sometimes it is harder.
          Examples:
<pre>
RETURNS: the temperature in Celsius that corresponds to the given
Fahrenheit temperature.

RETURNS: A scene like the given one, except that the given cat has
been painted on it.
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Examples:
          </strong>
          the examples should illustrate the different behaviors
          of the function, and should be designed to help readers
          to understand the purpose statement more quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Design Strategy:
          </strong>
          a short description of the idea used to derive the
          function definition from its purpose statement.
          Common design strategies include:
          <ol>
            <li>
              combine simpler functions
            </li>
            <li>
              use template for [data type] on [variable]
            </li>
            <li>
              divide into cases on [condition]
            </li>
            <li>
              use HOF [function] on [variable]
            </li>
            <li>
              call a more general function
            </li>
          </ol>
          For the first few problem sets, you will probably find
          yourself using only the first three of these design
          strategies.
          Although the strategies listed above are recommended
          when they apply, you are free to describe your design
          strategy in your own words, as a tweet-sized description
          of your thought process that might help course staff to
          answer the perennial question:
          What was this programmer thinking?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Function Definition:
          </strong>
          your definition of the function should make sense to
          the computer and also to human readers.
          If your design strategy is "use template", for example,
          then your function definition should follow the template
          for the appropriate data type(s).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Tests:
          </strong>
          you will generally define a separate test suite for
          each function by writing something like
          <pre>
(begin-for-test
  (check-equal?
    (length lobs-1)
    (length (bombs-after-tick lobs-1))
    "bombs-after-tick did not return a list the same length as its input")
  ...)
</pre>
          Tests created using <code>begin-for-test</code> will
          be executed as though they appeared at the end of the
          file.  In other words, <code>begin-for-test</code> is
          a magical syntax that allows you to place your unit
          tests near the function definition(s) they're testing,
          even if some of the tests refer to functions or values
          that haven't been defined yet.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Remember that at the end of every work session, before you commit
    and push a new version of your partial solution to your GitHub
    repository, you must commit a form
    <a href="yourID-log.txt">
      a form that records the time you spent in that work session.
    </a>


Remember that you must commit a copy of your log file</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    More deliverables will be required when we get to
    object-oriented programming.
