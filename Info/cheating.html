    Why You Shouldn't Cheat
  </h3>
  <p>
    The diploma you hope to earn will be a certificate representing
    the university's belief that <em>you</em> have attained a certain
    level of knowledge and skill within your degree program.
  </p>
  <p>
    The grade you earn in this course will represent our belief
    that <em>you</em> have attained a certain level of knowledge
    and skill within this course.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>You</em> means <em>you</em>.  It does not mean
    <em>you-with-help-from-your-friends</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Honest students become angry when their classmates are awarded
    a grade or diploma without putting in the effort needed to earn
    that reward.
  </p>
  <p>
    Faculty and advisors expect your grades to reflect your own
    knowledge and skill, not the knowledge and skill of others
    whose work you have stolen or used without authorization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The university expects your degree to reflect your own
    knowledge and skill, not the knowledge and skill of others.
    Every time a graduate of the university goes out into the
    world and performs poorly, it makes the whole university
    look bad.  It also devalues the diplomas earned by other
    graduates who acquired their diplomas honestly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Employers also expect your diploma to represent your own
    honest effort.  Employers do not want to hire cheaters.

  <h4>
    Why Industry Hates Cheaters
  </h4>
  <p>
    Most of the economically important applications of computer science
    involve
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">
      intellectual property</a>.
    The rules governing intellectual property are similar, though
    not identical, to rules established by Northeastern University's
    <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/">
      Academic Integrity Policy</a>
    and by CCIS and course rules.
    As explained by the current version of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_copyright#United_States">
      Wikipedia's article on software copyright:
    </a>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In the United States, computer programs are literary works,
      under the definition in the Copyright Act,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_17_of_the_United_States_Code">
        17 U.S.C.
      </a>
      §

      </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain amount of work that goes into making copyright
      successful and just as with other works, copyright for computer
      programs prohibits not only literal copying, but also copying
      of "nonliteral elements", such as [a] program's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure,_sequence_and_organization">
        structure, sequence and organization.
      </a>
      These non-literal aspects, however, can be protected only
      "to the extent that they incorporate authorship in
      programmer's expression of original ideas, as distinguished
      from the ideas themselves."

  <p>
    The university and course rules that prohibit unauthorized
    collaboration are similar to but simpler than the US laws
    and case law that protect programmers and their employers from
    unauthorized use of copyrighted software.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you can't follow the course rules, you probably won't
    obey US copyright law either.
  </p>
  <p>
    Employers know that students who cheat in school are apt
    to become employees who cheat at work.
    Employees who cheat can cost their employers a great deal
    of money.
    That's why employers try not to hire students who cheat.
  </p>
  <h3 id="what">
    What Counts as Cheating
  </h3>
  <p>
    You should read the university's
    <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/">
      Academic Integrity Policy,
    </a>
    paying special attention to its definitions of cheating,
    plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and facilitating
    academic dishonesty:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Cheating:
      </strong>
      The University defines cheating as using or attempting to
      use unauthorized materials, information, or
      study aids in any academic exercise. When completing any
      academic assignment, a student shall rely on his or her own
      mastery of the subject.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Plagiarism:
      </strong>
      The University defines plagiarism as using as one’s own the
      words, ideas, data, code, or other original academic material
      of another without providing proper citation or attribution.
      Plagiarism can apply to any assignment, either final or
      drafted copies, and it can occur either accidentally or
      deliberately.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Unauthorized Collaboration:
      </strong>
      The University defines unauthorized collaboration as
      instances when students submit individual academic works
      that are substantially similar to one another. While several
      students may have the same source material, any analysis,
      interpretation, or reporting of data required by an assignment
      must be each individual’s independent work unless the
      instructor has explicitly granted permission for group work.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Facilitating Academic Dishonesty:
      </strong>
      The University defines facilitating academic dishonesty as
      intentionally or knowingly helping or contributing to the
      violation of any provision of this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Doing academic work for another student.
      </li>
      <li>
        Making available previously used academic work for
        another individual who intends to resubmit the work for credit.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Those are general definitions because they apply to all
    colleges, departments, and courses within the university.
    The course rules, stated below, are even more specific.
  </p>
  <h4 id="what2">
    What Counts as Cheating in CS 5010
  </h4>
  <p>
    <em>Any</em> collaboration on or discussion of how to do a
    problem set, with anyone other than
    <!-- your assigned partner -->
    a member of the course staff, counts as cheating.
    In particular, any collaboration on or discussion of
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      general design of a program or function
    </li>
    <li>
      names of specific data types or functions
    </li>
    <li>
      definitions of specific data types or functions
    </li>
    <li>
      contracts, purpose statements, and invariants
    </li>
    <li>
      examples
    </li>
    <li>
      tests
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    counts as cheating unless those things are mentioned
    within the problem statement
    or in materials provided by course staff.
  </p>
  <p>
    Submitting code you did not write yourself is cheating, unless it
  is excerpted from the Examples files for the course.
    <!-- (When you have an assigned partner, that rule changes to: -->
    <!-- Submitting code you and your partner did not write yourselves -->
    <!-- is cheating.) -->
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing you must learn in this course is that code includes
    test cases and comments.
    If you <!-- (or you and your partner) --> did not write your own test
    cases and comments, you are cheating.
    (You are of course allowed to submit test cases and comments
    that appear within or have been derived from test cases and
    comments in materials provided by course staff.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Telling anyone about the questions you were asked during a
    codewalk is cheating.
    (It counts as facilitating academic dishonesty.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at someone else's code is cheating.
    That includes looking at test cases and comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Letting someone else look at your own code is cheating.
    That includes test cases and comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Giving someone a written or machine-readable copy of some
    of your test cases, comments, definitions, or other code
    is cheating.
    Accepting a copy is also cheating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leaving a copy of your solution or any part thereof
    in a public place where other students could steal it
    will be regarded as facilitating academic dishonesty,
    which counts as cheating even if you never intended
    for anyone to steal your work.
    That means you should never write part of your design
    or code on a white board or piece of paper or USB drive
    or any other medium where it could be seen or copied
    by other students.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, you should never leave your laptop
    unattended in any public place, even if access is
    protected by a password.  Someone might steal your
    laptop as well as your files.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reading similar programs written by students in a different
    section or semester is cheating.
    If, while surfing the web, you accidentally discover
    and start to read a program or code fragment that does
    something similar to what you have been asked to do in a problem set,
    then you should stop reading immediately, take note of its
    URL, and add a comment to your own solution that says
    you accidentally started to read the material
    located at that URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Telling someone about a web site you have discovered,
    even accidentally, that gives advice or contains code
    fragments that would make it easier to do a problem set
    is cheating.
    (Again, if you find a web site helpful to you as you are
    doing a problem set, you must cite that material and its
    URL in a comment within your program.  Failing to do so
    will be regarded as plagiarism, which is a form of academic
    dishonesty.)
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are ever unsure about what counts as cheating in this
    course, you should contact the course staff (via a private
    message to the instructors on Piazza) and ask.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you ever suspect that you or your partner may have
    violated course rules, you should contact the course
    staff.  It will go better for you if you tell us about
    it yourself instead of making us discover the violation.
  </p>
  <h3 id="allowed">
    What is Allowed
  </h3>
  <p>
    You are encouraged to study materials provided by the
    course staff and to discuss those materials with your
    fellow students, so long as you do not begin to discuss
    specific details of how those materials might be applied
    to a specific problem set.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are allowed to study standard reference materials
    such as the documentation for Racket, Git, and other
    tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are allowed to read books and articles and web pages
    that are not especially relevant to any problem sets
    assigned in CS 5010.
    (You should keep in mind that not everything you read
    is true.)
  </p>
  <p>
    You are allowed to read about algorithms and programming
    techniques that might be relevant to a problem set, so long
    as your solution to the problem set includes comments that
    cite any relevant material you have read.
    (Failure to cite relevant materials counts as plagiarism,
    which is a form of academic dishonesty.)
    You are not allowed to search the web for programs or
    program fragments that solve a problem similar to the one
    you have been asked to solve.
  </p>
  <h3 id="consequences">
    Consequences of Cheating
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you cheat, you will not learn as much as you should.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you cheat, you will probably be caught.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you are suspected of cheating, the instructor will
    invite you to discuss your solution in a private interview.
    Even if the instructor concludes you were not cheating,
    that interview will give the instructor a better idea of
    what you have learned in the course, which may influence
    your semester grade
    (<a href="grading.html#discretion">instructor's discretion</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    When you are caught cheating, your semester grade will
    be lowered.
  </p>
  <p>
    The instructor will also send a memo to
    Northeastern University's
    <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/">
      Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution
    </a>
    (OSCCR)
    that describes the incident and your part in it.
    University and CCIS policy require the instructor
    to write that memo and to report the incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    The instructor will send a copy of that memo to
    the CCIS Committee on Academic Integrity,
    as required by CCIS policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    OSCCR and CCIS may impose further sanctions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a first offense, OSCCR usually imposes some form
    of disciplinary probation and requires the student
    to perform some task designed to raise the student's
    awareness of the importance of academic honesty.
    For a second offense, OSCCR will probably suspend
    or expel the student from the university.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a first offense, CCIS may impose some sanction
    such as barring the student from co-op opportunities.
    For a second offense, CCIS usually expels the student
    from the MS program.

      <strong>
        Q:
      </strong>
      Why am I being accused of cheating, when I did nothing
      more than talk with my friend about how to do the
      problem set?
      <br />
      <strong>
        A:
      </strong>
      Because you knew that was
      <a href="#what2">against the rules</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Q:
      </strong>
      Why am I being accused of cheating, when I did nothing
      more than talk with my friend about how to test our
      programs?
      <br />
      <strong>
        A:
      </strong>
      Because you knew that was
      <a href="#what2">against the rules</a>.
      Tests are a very important part of your program,
      as are comments.

      <strong>
        Q:
      </strong>
      Why am I being accused of cheating, when what I did
      would not be considered wrong in my home country?
      <br />
      <strong>
        A:
      </strong>
      Because you enrolled in a graduate program located

      My friend can't figure out how to do the problem set.
      Should I help?
      <br />
      <strong>
        A:
      </strong>
      No.  If you help a student who is not your partner

      Why not cheat?
      <br />
      <strong>
        A:
      </strong>
      Because you won't learn as much if you cheat, and
      a low grade for the assignment won't hurt your
      semester grade as much as cheating will.

      <br />
      <strong>
        A:

      You'll get a zero for the problem set even if you cheat,

      If you drop the course, you'll be allowed to try again.
      If you try to cheat your way through it,

      <strong>
        A:
      </strong>
      Because you won't pass this course by cheating.
      If you don't think you can pass CS 5010 without cheating,
