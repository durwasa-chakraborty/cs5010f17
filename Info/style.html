  <h2>
    Style Guide
  </h2>
  <p>
    Programs are easier to read and to understand when they
    are written in a familiar style and follow standard coding
    conventions.
    Most organizations that develop software therefore require
    programmers to write programs that follow the organization's
    preferred style and coding conventions.  These conventions can be
  very elaborate.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="smaller">
    <p>
      <strong>
        Example:
      </strong>
      <a href="http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html">
        C++ Programming Style Guidelines
      </a>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Although guidelines are often
    arbitrary, arbitrary deviation from accepted style makes
    readers wonder why the code is written so strangely.
    Is there some peculiarity of the particular program that
    motivates the nonstandard style?  Or is the programmer
    using nonstandard style merely because the programmer is
    inexperienced or unfamiliar with the programming
    language or with software development in general?
  </p>
  <p>
    In CS 5010, we want you to use the coding style and
    conventions described here.  We have attepted to keep our
  conventions as simple as possible, consistent with making your code
  readable by the course staff and reusable by you.
    We have divided our guidelines into three groups:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="#general">
        general guidelines</a>
      that are largely independent of the programming
      language(s) you are using
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#specific">
        language-specific guidelines</a>
      you should follow when programming in Racket
      or in similar languages such as Scheme or Clojure
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#course">
        course-specific guidelines</a>
      you should follow in this course
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="general">
    General Guidelines
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Design Guidelines
  </h4>
  <p>
    If you have been given a specification to implement,
    you are not allowed to change that specification.
    If you believe the specification is itself incorrect,
    you should ask the person(s) who gave you the specification
    to correct it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, you are not allowed to change the names,
    contracts, or purpose statements of functions or methods
    you have been asked to write.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    Changing any of those things will prevent your code from
    working when it is combined with other parts of the program
    that rely on the given specifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, you are not allowed to change the definitions of
    any types defined by the specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Function and method definitions should be short.
    If you find yourself writing a long function or method,
    you should probably define one or more help functions
    that would allow you to write a shorter and clearer
    definition of that function or method.    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em> Dividing a function or method body into smaller pieces not
  only makes the definition clearer; it also allows the pieces to be
  tested independently, making debugging easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    When designing your own help functions and methods,
    each function or method should accomplish exactly one
    thing.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    Functions and methods that try to accomplish several
    things at once will be harder to read, and they will
    also be harder to reuse as your program evolves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try not to recompute the same value(s) repeatedly.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    Performing exactly the same computation multiple times
    is inefficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't write the same or similar code in multiple places.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    If you find yourself writing similar code within two or
    more definitions, you should probably write a help function
    that accomplishes the common task and call that help function
    from within all definitions of functions and methods that
    need to accomplish the task.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't hard-wire magic numbers within your code.
    Although occurrences of 0 and 1 within your code will
    probably always be zero and one, other numerical
    constants may be subject to change as your
    program evolves.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    Even if you think the numerical constant 3.141592653589793
    is unlikely to change, multiple copies of that constant
    are less readable and more prone to editing mistakes
    than a symbolic name such as PI.
    Furthermore, the numerical value of pi might depend
    on the precision of your floating point hardware and
    libraries, which are more likely to change than you
    may realize.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't hard-wire any kind of magic constants within your code.
    That includes strings used to name the legal values of
    itemization data.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    You may think repeating the string "red" throughout your
    program is just as readable as repeating the symbolic
    constant RED, but some future refactoring of your program
    might change the value of that constant to
    <code>0xf80000</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the value of a boolean expression is being used to
    compute a boolean value, you don't need a conditional
    expression or statement.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    <code>(x > 0) ? true : false</code>
    is equivalent to
    <code>(x > 0)</code>, which is shorter and easier to read.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Naming Guidelines
  </h4>
  <p>
    Most programming languages are case-sensitive,
    but you should never use two different names in the
    same scope whose only difference is the casing of one or
    more letters.
    Even if your programming language is not case-sensitive,
    you should use consistent case for every reference to a
    name.
  </p>
  <p>
    <xa href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2016/06/16/long-names-are-long/">
      The larger the scope of a name, the more important it is
      to use a meaningful name</a>.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    An index variable whose scope is confined to a small
    <code>for</code> loop might well be named <code>i</code>,
    but using <code>i</code> as the name of a global or
    instance variable is ill-advised.  On the other hand, names that
  are <a
  href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2016/06/16/long-names-are-long/">too
  long</a> can be cumbersome.   Some useful advice on choosing names
  is <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2009/06/05/naming-things-in-code/" >here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When naming a function that has no side effects,
    the name of the function should be a noun that describes
    the information represented by the result of the function,
    possibly augmented by some succinct suggestion of the
    relationship between that result and (some of) the arguments.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    When naming a function that returns the quotient of
    <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> modulo <code>n</code>,
    <code>quotientModN</code> is a better name than
    <code>divideXbyY</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When naming a function or method that operates by side
    effect, its name should be a verb that describes the side
    effect.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    When naming a method that converts its argument to a string
    and prints that string, <code>print</code> is a better name
    than <code>asString</code>.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Formatting Guidelines
  </h4>
  <p>
    Do not write any lines that are longer than 80 characters.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    Long lines are harder to read.
    Long lines are especially hard to read if they wrap when
    the font size is increased to make your code readable when
    displayed by a video projector during code reviews.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not use any tab characters in your programs.
    <em>
      Rationale:
    </em>
    Tabs have no standard interpretation.
    Your organization may impose its own standard interpretation
    of tab characters, but tab characters can still make your code
    look weird when viewed by anyone who is using display software
    that hasn't been adjusted to match your organization's preferred
    interpretation.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    In this course, we will use DrRacket, GitHub, and editors such
    as Emacs to examine your code.  If your code contains tab
    characters, its indentation will change depending on the tool
    used to view it.  If its indentation looks wrong when we view
    it, you will be criticized for improper indentation, and you
    will deserve that criticism.
  </p>
  <h3 id="specific">
    Language-specific Guidelines
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Racket project has published its own
    <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/style/">
      style guidelines
    </a>
    for programmers using Racket.
    For CS 5010, we ask you to follow the simplified guidelines
    listed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Functions that return a boolean are known as predicates.
    Their names should end with a question mark.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    <code>string?</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Functions that do not return a useful value,
    so they are executed only for their side effects,
    should have names that end with an exclamation mark.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    <code>vector-set!</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    DrRacket's editor can indent your code for you.
    Even if you prefer to indent your code yourself,
    your indentation should be almost indistinguishable
    from the indentation suggested by DrRacket.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every left parenthesis should appear at the beginning
    of a line, or preceded by another left parenthesis,
    or preceded by a space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right parentheses should not be preceded by a space,
    with one exception: the right parentheses that follow
    a long list of items, each indented individually, may
    be on a line by themselves, preceded by a space, and
    indented to line up with the items above them.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <code>if</code> expression's test expression should
    begin on the same line as the <code>if</code>.
    Unless the <code>if</code> expression is very short,
    its then and else parts should each begin on separate
    lines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every <code>cond</code> clause should begin on a separate line.
    The first <code>cond</code> clause should begin on the
    same line as the <code>cond</code>.
    (Professor Wand's online materials often put the first
    <code>cond</code> on the following line.  That's acceptable
    practice but I don't recommend it.)
    All subsequent <code>cond</code> clauses should begin
    on a new line, properly indented.
  </p>
  <h3 id="course">
    Course-specific Guidelines
  </h3>
  <p>
    Each file of code should start with a purpose statement
    explaining what the code is intended to accomplish.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>require</code> declarations go next,
    followed by <code>provide</code> declarations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data definitions and global constant definitions belong
    near the beginning of a file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Constant names should consist entirely of capital letters
    and hyphens.
    <em>
      Example:
    </em>
    <code>INITIAL-VELOCITY</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Type names begin with a capital letter.
    If a type name is formed from two or more words, use
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">
      CamelCase.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Structure and field names do not begin with a capital letter.
    They should look like variable names.
  </p>
  <p>
    In variable names, use hyphens to separate words, not
    underscores or CamelCase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unit tests belong in the same file with the definitions
    they test.
    Short tests can be placed directly after the function(s)
    they test, where they can serve as examples.
    Longer tests can go near the end of the file.
