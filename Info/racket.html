  <h2>
    Why We Use Racket
  </h2>
  <p>
    You probably hadn't heard of the Racket programming language
    before you enrolled at NU, and you might well wonder why we're
    using such an obscure programming language in this course.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first thing you need to understand is that CS 5010 is
    <strong><em>not</em></strong>
    about programming in Racket, or in any other specific language.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Program Design Paradigms
  </h3>
  <p>
    CS 5010 is about program design.
  </p>
  <p>
    As technology has advanced, functional and object-oriented paradigms
    have been displacing the imperative programming paradigm you may
  have been taught as an undergraduate.
    The imperative paradigm remains relevant, and we will discuss
    its uses during the second half of the semester, but we focus
    on the functional and object-oriented paradigms because most
    incoming MS students have less experience with those paradigms,
    and because those paradigms are becoming more important in
    industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    To teach these program design paradigms effectively, we need
    a multi-paradigm language that is easy to learn quickly and
    provides good support for educational applications of the
    language.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Popularity versus Love
  </h3>
  <p>
    Those requirements rule out many of the languages that remain,
    for the moment,
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-popular-technologies">
      most popular in industry</a>.
    It might be better to use one of the
    eight languages that, according to a
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">
      survey conducted by Stack Overflow</a>,
    are most <em>loved</em> by software developers:
    Rust, Swift, F#, Scala, Go, Clojure, React, Haskell.
  Unfortunately, most of those well-loved languages are fairly new,
    and have not had time to accumulate the pedagogical tools
    we rely upon in this course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Racket is quite similar to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">Clojure</a>.
    Like F#, Scala, Clojure, and Haskell, Racket offers excellent
    support for the functional paradigm.
    Unlike the most-loved languages in Stack Overflow's survey,
    Racket was designed for educational use and offers
    pedagogical tools and course materials that have benefited
    from decades of development.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's why we use Racket in this course.
