  <h2>
    Homework Policies
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Problem Sets
  </h3>
  <p>
    A new problem set will go out every Monday.
    <!-- except for the first week of class -->
    <!-- (because -->
    <!-- <a href="../ProblemSets/ps00.html"> -->
    <!--   Problem Set 00 -->
    <!-- </a> -->
    <!-- had gone out on the previous Tuesday) -->
    <!-- and the Monday of spring break. -->
  </p>
  <p>
    As with all software projects, specifications may change.
    Significant changes will be announced on Piazza and
    noted on the web page that describes the problem set.
    All students are responsible for noting these changes
    and incorporating them into their solutions.
    Adapting to changing specifications can be difficult,
    but it will be easier if you write clear, readable,
    well-designed programs.
  </p>
  <h4>
    No Pair Programming
  </h4>
  <p>
    All problem sets will be individual assignments,
    where you are not allowed to discuss your design or code
    with other students.
  </p>

  <p>Previous editions of this course had students work in pairs for
  some problem sets.  We will NOT be doing this in Fall 2017.</p>

  <h4>
    Source Control
  </h4>
  <p>
    You are required to commit the current state of your solution
    to your GitHub repository at the end of every work session.
    Failure to commit regularly may be regarded as evidence of
    <a href="cheating.html">
      cheating</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Time on Task
  </h4>
  <p>
    At the end of every work session, before you commit
    and push a new version of your partial solution to your GitHub
    repository, you must commit a file named
    <a href="yourID-log.txt"><em>yourID</em>-log.txt</a>
    that records the time you spent in that work
    session.  This form also includes a certification that all the
    work in your commit is your own
  </p>
  <h4>
    Submission
  </h4>
  <p>
    Problem sets are generally due every Monday at 6pm.
    (Problem Set 00 is an exception to this rule.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Shortly after 6pm on the Monday a problem set is due,
    we will collect your solution as it exists in your GitHub
    repository.  This is an automated process.
    Extensions are rarely granted, never without very good
    reason, and should be requested in advance.
    Forgetting to sync (push) your solution with your GitHub
    repository is not a good reason for requesting an extension;
    such requests will be denied.
    If you sync (push) at the end of every work session,
    as required, you will not forget to do so before the deadline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon after your submission has been collected from your
    GitHub repository, it will be tested for correctness.
    This too is an automated process.
    At the end of each week a problem set is due, a file
    containing the results of our automated testing will
    be added to your GitHub repository.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results of correctness testing will account for almost
    one third of your semester grade.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Codewalks
  </h3>
  <p>
    During the week following your submission of a problem set,
    you will explain your code and its design to course staff
    and a small audience of other students.
    These <em>codewalks</em> are designed to simulate the code
    reviews that have become standard practice in industry,
    while providing you with constructive feedback from course
    staff.
  </p>
  <p>
    The codewalks give you an opportunity to explain and to defend
    your design and coding practices to course staff.
    The quality of your presentations will be graded, and those
    grades will account for almost one fifth of your semester
    grade.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on your presentation and our own examination of your code,
    the course staff who conduct your codewalk will give you a separate
    letter grade for your design.
    Those design grades will account for almost half of your
    semester grade.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Scheduling of Codewalks
  </h4>
  <p>
    We will ask you to state your preferences for the scheduling
    of your codewalks, and we will try to honor your preferences,
    but the number of codewalk slots is just barely large enough
    to complete all codewalks so your codewalks are unlikely to
    be scheduled at the times you would most prefer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Failure to appear at the time of your assigned codewalk is
    likely to earn you an F for the presentation and design portions
    of that problem set.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Structure of Codewalks
  </h4>
  <p>
    For problem sets done by individual students, the codewalks
    will last about 15 minutes.
    <!-- For problem sets done by students working in pairs, the -->
    <!-- codewalks will last about 30 minutes. -->
  </p>
  <!-- <p> -->
  <!--   When students are assigned to work in pairs, both students -->
  <!--   are responsible for the team's entire solution and may be -->
  <!--   called upon to explain any part of the team's solution. -->
